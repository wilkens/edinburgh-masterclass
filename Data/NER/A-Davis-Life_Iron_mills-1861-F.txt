		LIFE IN THE IRON-MILLS by
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	`` Is this the end ?

		O Life , as futile , then , as frail !

		What hope of answer or redress ? ''

		A cloudy day : do you know what that is in a town of iron-works ?

		The sky sank down before dawn , muddy , flat , immovable .

		The air is thick , clammy with the breath of crowded human beings .

		It stifles me .

		I open the window , and , looking out , can scarcely see through the rain the grocer 's shop opposite , where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing
Lynchburg	LOCATION	tobacco in their pipes .

		I can detect the scent through all the foul smells ranging loose in the air .

		The idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke .

		It rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundries , and settles down in black , slimy pools on the muddy streets .

		Smoke on the wharves , smoke on the dingy boats , on the yellow river , -- clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front , the two faded poplars , the faces of the passers-by .

		The long train of mules , dragging masses of pig-iron through the narrow street , have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides .

		Here , inside , is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from the mantel-shelf ; but even its wings are covered with smoke , clotted and black .

		Smoke everywhere !

		A dirty canary chirps desolately in a cage beside me .

		Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old dream , -- almost worn out , I think .

		From the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to the river-side , strewed with rain-butts and tubs .

		The river , dull and tawny-colored , -LRB- la belle riviere ! -RRB-

		drags itself sluggishly along , tired of the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges .

		What wonder ?

		When I was a child , I used to fancy a look of weary , dumb appeal upon the face of the negro-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day .

		Something of the same idle notion comes to me to-day , when from the street-window I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past , night and morning , to the great mills .

		Masses of men , with dull , besotted faces bent to the ground , sharpened here and there by pain or cunning ; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes ; stooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal , laired by day in dens of drunkenness and infamy ; breathing from infancy to death an air saturated with fog and grease and soot , vileness for soul and body .

		What do you make of a case like that , amateur psychologist ?

		You call it an altogether serious thing to be alive : to these men it is a drunken jest , a joke , -- horrible to angels perhaps , to them commonplace enough .

		My fancy about the river was an idle one : it is no type of such a life .

		What if it be stagnant and slimy here ?

		It knows that beyond there waits for it odorous sunlight , quaint old gardens , dusky with soft , green foliage of apple-trees , and flushing crimson with roses , -- air , and fields , and mountains .

		The future of the Welsh puddler passing just now is not so pleasant .

		To be stowed away , after his grimy work is done , in a hole in the muddy graveyard , and after that , not air , nor green fields , nor curious roses .

		Can you see how foggy the day is ?

		As I stand here , idly tapping the windowpane , and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and the coalboats below , fragments of an old story float up before me , -- a story of this house into which I happened to come to-day .

		You may think it a tiresome story enough , as foggy as the day , sharpened by no sudden flashes of pain or pleasure .

		-- I know : only the outline of a dull life , that long since , with thousands of dull lives like its own , was vainly lived and lost : thousands of them , massed , vile , slimy lives , like those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt .

		-- Lost ?

		There is a curious point for you to settle , my friend , who study psychology in a lazy , dilettante way .

		Stop a moment .

		I am going to be honest .

		This is what I want you to do .

		I want you to hide your disgust , take no heed to your clean clothes , and come right down with me , -- here , into the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia .

		I want you to hear this story .

		There is a secret down here , in this nightmare fog , that has lain dumb for centuries : I want to make it a real thing to you .

		You , Egoist , or Pantheist , or Arminian , busy in making straight paths for your feet on the hills , do not see it clearly , -- this terrible question which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer .

		I dare not put this secret into words .

		I told you it was dumb .

		These men , going by with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power , do not ask it of Society or of God .

		Their lives ask it ; their deaths ask it .

		There is no reply .

		I will tell you plainly that I have a great hope ; and I bring it to you to be tested .

		It is this : that this terrible dumb question is its own reply ; that it is not the sentence of death we think it , but , from the very extremity of its darkness , the most solemn prophecy which the world has known of the Hope to come .

		I dare make my meaning no clearer , but will only tell my story .

		It will , perhaps , seem to you as foul and dark as this thick vapor about us , and as pregnant with death ; but if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper , no perfume-tinted dawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come .

		My story is very simple , -- Only what I remember of the life of one of these men , -- a furnace-tender in one of
Kirby	PERSON	&
John	PERSON	's rolling-mills , --
Hugh Wolfe	PERSON	.

		You know the mills ?

		They took the great order for the lower
Virginia	LOCATION	railroads there last winter ; run usually with about a thousand men .

		I can not tell why I choose the half-forgotten story of this
Wolfe	PERSON	more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands .

		Perhaps because there is a secret , underlying sympathy between that story and this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine , -- or perhaps simply for the reason that this house is the one where the
Wolfes	ORGANIZATION	lived .

		There were the father and son , -- both hands , as I said , in one of
Kirby	PERSON	&
John	PERSON	's mills for making railroad-iron , -- and
Deborah	PERSON	, their cousin , a picker in some of the cotton-mills .

		The house was rented then to half a dozen families .

		The
Wolfes	ORGANIZATION	had two of the cellar-rooms .

		The old man , like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills , was Welsh , -- had spent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines .

		You may pick the Welsh emigrants ,
Cornish	PERSON	miners , out of the throng passing the windows , any day .

		They are a trifle more filthy ; their muscles are not so brawny ; they stoop more .

		When they are drunk , they neither yell , nor shout , nor stagger , but skulk along like beaten hounds .

		A pure , unmixed blood , I fancy : shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharply-cut facial lines .

		It is nearly thirty years since the
Wolfes	ORGANIZATION	lived here .

		Their lives were like those of their class : incessant labor , sleeping in kennel-like rooms , eating rank pork and molasses , drinking -- God and the distillers only know what ; with an occasional night in jail , to atone for some drunken excess .

		Is that all of their lives ?

		-- of the portion given to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets to-day ?

		-- nothing beneath ?

		-- all ?

		So many a political reformer will tell you , -- and many a private reformer , too , who has gone among them with a heart tender with
Christ	PERSON	's charity , and come out outraged , hardened .

		One rainy night , about eleven o'clock , a crowd of half-clothed women stopped outside of the cellar-door .

		They were going home from the cotton-mill .

		`` Good-night ,
Deb	PERSON	, '' said one , a mulatto , steadying herself against the gas-post .

		She needed the post to steady her .

		So did more than one of them .

		``
Dah	PERSON	's a ball to Miss
Potts	PERSON	' to-night .


Ye	PERSON	'd best come . ''

		`` Inteet ,
Deb	PERSON	, if hur 'll come , hur 'll hef fun , '' said a shrill Welsh voice in the crowd .

		Two or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman , who was groping for the latch of the door .

		`` No . ''

		`` No ?

		Where 's Kit Small , then ? ''

		`` Begorra !

		on the spools .

		Alleys behint , though we helped her , we dud .

		An wid ye !

		Let
Deb	PERSON	alone !

		It 's ondacent frettin ' a quite body .

		Be the powers , an we 'll have a night of it !

		there 'll be lashin 's o ' drink , -- the Vargent be blessed and praised for ` t ! ''

		They went on , the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight , and drag the woman
Wolfe	PERSON	off with them ; but , being pacified , she staggered away .


Deborah	PERSON	groped her way into the cellar , and , after considerable stumbling , kindled a match , and lighted a tallow dip , that sent a yellow glimmer over the room .

		It was low , damp , -- the earthen floor covered with a green , slimy moss , -- a fetid air smothering the breath .

		Old
Wolfe	PERSON	lay asleep on a heap of straw , wrapped in a torn horse-blanket .

		He was a pale , meek little man , with a white face and red rabbit-eyes .

		The woman
Deborah	PERSON	was like him ; only her face was even more ghastly , her lips bluer , her eyes more watery .

		She wore a faded cotton gown and a slouching bonnet .

		When she walked , one could see that she was deformed , almost a hunchback .

		She trod softly , so as not to waken him , and went through into the room beyond .

		There she found by the half-extinguished fire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes , which she put upon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale .

		Placing the old candlestick beside this dainty repast , she untied her bonnet , which hung limp and wet over her face , and prepared to eat her supper .

		It was the first food that had touched her lips since morning .

		There was enough of it , however : there is not always .

		She was hungry , -- one could see that easily enough , -- and not drunk , as most of her companions would have been found at this hour .

		She did not drink , this woman , -- her face told that , too , -- nothing stronger than ale .

		Perhaps the weak , flaccid wretch had some stimulant in her pale life to keep her up , -- some love or hope , it might be , or urgent need .

		When that stimulant was gone , she would take to whiskey .

		Man can not live by work alone .

		While she was skinning the potatoes , and munching them , a noise behind her made her stop .

		`` Janey ! ''

		she called , lifting the candle and peering into the darkness .

		``
Janey	PERSON	, are you there ? ''

		A heap of ragged coats was heaved up , and the face of a young girl emerged , staring sleepily at the woman .

		``
Deborah	PERSON	, '' she said , at last , `` I 'm here the night . ''

		`` Yes , child .


Hur	PERSON	's welcome , '' she said , quietly eating on .

		The girl 's face was haggard and sickly ; her eyes were heavy with sleep and hunger : real Milesian eyes they were , dark , delicate blue , glooming out from black shadows with a pitiful fright .

		`` I was alone , '' she said , timidly .

		`` Where 's the father ? ''

		asked
Deborah	PERSON	, holding out a potato , which the girl greedily seized .

		`` He 's beyant , -- wid
Haley	PERSON	, -- in the stone house . ''

		-LRB- Did you ever hear the word tail from an Irish mouth ? -RRB-

		`` I came here .


Hugh	PERSON	told me never to stay me-lone . ''

		``
Hugh	PERSON	? ''

		`` Yes . ''

		A vexed frown crossed her face .

		The girl saw it , and added quickly , -- `` I have not seen
Hugh	PERSON	the day ,
Deb	PERSON	.

		The old man says his watch lasts till the mornin ' . ''

		The woman sprang up , and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch in a tin pail , and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle .

		Tying on her bonnet , she blew out the candle .

		`` Lay ye down ,
Janey	PERSON	dear , '' she said , gently , covering her with the old rags .

		`` Hur can eat the potatoes , if hur 's hungry .

		`` Where are ye goin ' ,
Deb	PERSON	?

		The rain 's sharp . ''

		`` To the mill , with
Hugh	PERSON	's supper . ''

		`` Let him bide till th ' morn .

		Sit ye down . ''

		`` No , no , '' -- sharply pushing her off .

		`` The boy 'll starve . ''

		She hurried from the cellar , while the child wearily coiled herself up for sleep .

		The rain was falling heavily , as the woman , pail in hand , emerged from the mouth of the alley , and turned down the narrow street , that stretched out , long and black , miles before her .

		Here and there a flicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter ; the long rows of houses , except an occasional lager-bier shop , were closed ; now and then she met a band of millhands skulking to or from their work .

		Not many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast machinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed , that goes on unceasingly from year to year .

		The hands of each mill are divided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the sentinels of an army .

		By night and day the work goes on , the unsleeping engines groan and shriek , the fiery pools of metal boil and surge .

		Only for a day in the week , in half-courtesy to public censure , the fires are partially veiled ; but as soon as the clock strikes midnight , the great furnaces break forth with renewed fury , the clamor begins with fresh , breathless vigor , the engines sob and shriek like `` gods in pain . ''

		As
Deborah	PERSON	hurried down through the heavy rain , the noise of these thousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like far-off thunder .

		The mill to which she was going lay on the river , a mile below the city-limits .

		It was far , and she was weak , aching from standing twelve hours at the spools .

		Yet it was her almost nightly walk to take this man his supper , though at every square she sat down to rest , and she knew she should receive small word of thanks .

		Perhaps , if she had possessed an artist 's eye , the picturesque oddity of the scene might have made her step stagger less , and the path seem shorter ; but to her the mills were only `` summat deilish to look at by night . ''

		The road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock , which rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder-covered road , while the river , sluggish and black , crept past on the other .

		The mills for rolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs , covering acres of ground , open on every side .

		Beneath these roofs
Deborah	PERSON	looked in on a city of fires , that burned hot and fiercely in the night .

		Fire in every horrible form : pits of flame waving in the wind ; liquid metal-flames writhing in tortuous streams through the sand ; wide caldrons filled with boiling fire , over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the strange brewing ; and through all , crowds of half-clad men , looking like revengeful ghosts in the red light , hurried , throwing masses of glittering fire .

		It was like a street in Hell .

		Even
Deborah	PERSON	muttered , as she crept through , `` looks like t ' Devil 's place ! ''

		It did , -- in more ways than one .

		She found the man she was looking for , at last , heaping coal on a furnace .

		He had not time to eat his supper ; so she went behind the furnace , and waited .

		Only a few men were with him , and they noticed her only by a `` Hyur comes t ` hunchback ,
Wolfe	PERSON	. ''


Deborah	PERSON	was stupid with sleep ; her back pained her sharply ; and her teeth chattered with cold , with the rain that soaked her clothes and dripped from her at every step .

		She stood , however , patiently holding the pail , and waiting .

		`` Hout , woman !

		ye look like a drowned cat .

		Come near to the fire , '' -- said one of the men , approaching to scrape away the ashes .

		She shook her head .


Wolfe	PERSON	had forgotten her .

		He turned , hearing the man , and came closer .

		`` I did no ' think ; gi ' me my supper , woman . ''

		She watched him eat with a painful eagerness .

		With a woman 's quick instinct , she saw that he was not hungry , -- was eating to please her .

		Her pale , watery eyes began to gather a strange light .

		`` Is ' t good ,
Hugh	PERSON	?

		T ' ale was a bit sour , I feared . ''

		`` No , good enough . ''

		He hesitated a moment .

		`` Ye 're tired , poor lass !

		Bide here till I go .

		Lay down there on that heap of ash , and go to sleep . ''

		He threw her an old coat for a pillow , and turned to his work .

		The heap was the refuse of the burnt iron , and was not a hard bed ; the half-smothered warmth , too , penetrated her limbs , dulling their pain and cold shiver .

		Miserable enough she looked , lying there on the ashes like a limp , dirty rag , -- yet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless discomfort and veiled crime : more fitting , if one looked deeper into the heart of things , at her thwarted woman 's form , her colorless life , her waking stupor that smothered pain and hunger , -- even more fit to be a type of her class .

		Deeper yet if one could look , was there nothing worth reading in this wet , faded thing , halfcovered with ashes ?

		no story of a soul filled with groping passionate love , heroic unselfishness , fierce jealousy ?

		of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom she loved , to gain one look of real heart-kindness from him ?

		If anything like this were hidden beneath the pale , bleared eyes , and dull , washed-out-looking face , no one had ever taken the trouble to read its faint signs : not the half-clothed furnace-tender ,
Wolfe	PERSON	, certainly .

		Yet he was kind to her : it was his nature to be kind , even to the very rats that swarmed in the cellar : kind to her in just the same way .

		She knew that .

		And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its apathy and vacancy more than her low , torpid life .

		One sees that dead , vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest , finest of women 's faces , -- in the very midst , it may be , of their warmest summer 's day ; and then one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid beneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile .

		There was no warmth , no brilliancy , no summer for this woman ; so the stupor and vacancy had time to gnaw into her face perpetually .

		She was young , too , though no one guessed it ; so the gnawing was the fiercer .

		She lay quiet in the dark corner , listening , through the monotonous din and uncertain glare of the works , to the dull plash of the rain in the far distance , shrinking back whenever the man
Wolfe	PERSON	happened to look towards her .

		She knew , in spite of all his kindness , that there was that in her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her .

		She felt by instinct , although she could not comprehend it , the finer nature of the man , which made him among his fellow-workmen something unique , set apart .

		She knew , that , down under all the vileness and coarseness of his life , there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and pure , that his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity , even when his words were kindest .

		Through this dull consciousness , which never left her , came , like a sting , the recollection of the dark blue eyes and lithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar .

		The recollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow of beauty and of grace .

		Little
Janey	PERSON	, timid , helpless , clinging to
Hugh	PERSON	as her only friend : that was the sharp thought , the bitter thought , that drove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain .

		You laugh at it ?

		Are pain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am taking you to than in your own house or your own heart , -- your heart , which they clutch at sometimes ?

		The note is the same , I fancy , be the octave high or low .

		If you could go into this mill where
Deborah	PERSON	lay , and drag out from the hearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives , taking it as a symptom of the disease of their class , no ghost Horror would terrify you more .

		A reality of soul-starvation , of living death , that meets you every day under the besotted faces on the street , -- I can paint nothing of this , only give you the outside outlines of a night , a crisis in the life of one man : whatever muddy depth of soul-history lies beneath you can read according to the eyes God has given you .


Wolfe	PERSON	, while
Deborah	PERSON	watched him as a spaniel its master , bent over the furnace with his iron pole , unconscious of her scrutiny , only stopping to receive orders .

		Physically , Nature had promised the man but little .

		He had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man , his muscles were thin , his nerves weak , his face -LRB- a meek , woman 's face -RRB- haggard , yellow with consumption .

		In the mill he was known as one of the girl-men : ``
Molly Wolfe	PERSON	'' was his sobriquet .

		He was never seen in the cockpit , did not own a terrier , drank but seldom ; when he did , desperately .

		He fought sometimes , but was always thrashed , pommelled to a jelly .

		The man was game enough , when his blood was up : but he was no favorite in the mill ; he had the taint of school-learning on him , -- not to a dangerous extent , only a quarter or so in the free-school in fact , but enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight .

		For other reasons , too , he was not popular .

		Not one of themselves , they felt that , though outwardly as filthy and ash-covered ; silent , with foreign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in innumerable curious ways : this one , for instance .

		In the neighboring furnace-buildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the pig-metal is run .

		Korl we call it here : a light , porous substance , of a delicate , waxen , flesh-colored tinge .

		Out of the blocks of this korl ,
Wolfe	PERSON	, in his off-hours from the furnace , had a habit of chipping and moulding figures , -- hideous , fantastic enough , but sometimes strangely beautiful : even the mill-men saw that , while they jeered at him .

		It was a curious fancy in the man , almost a passion .

		The few hours for rest he spent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife , never speaking , until his watch came again , -- working at one figure for months , and , when it was finished , breaking it to pieces perhaps , in a fit of disappointment .

		A morbid , gloomy man , untaught , unled , left to feed his soul in grossness and crime , and hard , grinding labor .

		I want you to come down and look at this
Wolfe	PERSON	, standing there among the lowest of his kind , and see him just as he is , that you may judge him justly when you hear the story of this night .

		I want you to look back , as he does every day , at his birth in vice , his starved infancy ; to remember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and man , -- the slow , heavy years of constant , hot work .

		So long ago he began , that he thinks sometimes he has worked there for ages .

		There is no hope that it will ever end .

		Think that God put into this man 's soul a fierce thirst for beauty , -- to know it , to create it ; to be -- something , he knows not what , -- other than he is .

		There are moments when a passing cloud , the sun glinting on the purple thistles , a kindly smile , a child 's face , will rouse him to a passion of pain , -- when his nature starts up with a mad cry of rage against God , man , whoever it is that has forced this vile , slimy life upon him .

		With all this groping , this mad desire , a great blind intellect stumbling through wrong , a loving poet 's heart , the man was by habit only a coarse , vulgar laborer , familiar with sights and words you would blush to name .

		Be just : when I tell you about this night , see him as he is .

		Be just , -- not like man 's law , which seizes on one isolated fact , but like God 's judging angel , whose clear , sad eye saw all the countless cankering days of this man 's life , all the countless nights , when , sick with starving , his soul fainted in him , before it judged him for this night , the saddest of all .

		I called this night the crisis of his life .

		If it was , it stole on him unawares .

		These great turning-days of life cast no shadow before , slip by unconsciously .

		Only a trifle , a little turn of the rudder , and the ship goes to heaven or hell .


Wolfe	PERSON	, while
Deborah	PERSON	watched him , dug into the furnace of melting iron with his pole , dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield .

		It was late , -- nearly Sunday morning ; another hour , and the heavy work would be done , only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next day .

		The workmen were growing more noisy , shouting , as they had to do , to be heard over the deep clamor of the mills .

		Suddenly they grew less boisterous , -- at the far end , entirely silent .

		Something unusual had happened .

		After a moment , the silence came nearer ; the men stopped their jeers and drunken choruses .


Deborah	PERSON	, stupidly lifting up her head , saw the cause of the quiet .

		A group of five or six men were slowly approaching , stopping to examine each furnace as they came .

		Visitors often came to see the mills after night : except by growing less noisy , the men took no notice of them .

		The furnace where
Wolfe	PERSON	worked was near the bounds of the works ; they halted there hot and tired : a walk over one of these great foundries is no trifling task .

		The woman , drawing out of sight , turned over to sleep .


Wolfe	PERSON	, seeing them stop , suddenly roused from his indifferent stupor , and watched them keenly .

		He knew some of them : the overseer ,
Clarke	PERSON	, -- a son of
Kirby	PERSON	, one of the mill-owners , -- and a Doctor May , one of the town-physicians .

		The other two were strangers .


Wolfe	PERSON	came closer .

		He seized eagerly every chance that brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down on him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being .

		What made the difference between them ?

		That was the mystery of his life .

		He had a vague notion that perhaps to-night he could find it out .

		One of the strangers sat down on a pile of bricks , and beckoned young
Kirby	PERSON	to his side .

		`` This is hot , with a vengeance .

		A match , please ? ''

		-- lighting his cigar .

		`` But the walk is worth the trouble .

		If it were not that you must have heard it so often ,
Kirby	PERSON	, I would tell you that your works look like
Dante	PERSON	's Inferno . ''


Kirby	PERSON	laughed .

		`` Yes .

		Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb , '' -- pointing to some figure in the shimmering shadows .

		`` Judging from some of the faces of your men , '' said the other , `` they bid fair to try the reality of
Dante	PERSON	's vision , some day . ''

		Young
Kirby	PERSON	looked curiously around , as if seeing the faces of his hands for the first time .

		`` They 're bad enough , that 's true .

		A desperate set , I fancy .

		Eh ,
Clarke	PERSON	? ''

		The overseer did not hear him .

		He was talking of net profits just then , -- giving , in fact , a schedule of the annual business of the firm to a sharp peering little Yankee , who jotted down notes on a paper laid on the crown of his hat : a reporter for one of the city-papers , getting up a series of reviews of the leading manufactories .

		The other gentlemen had accompanied them merely for amusement .

		They were silent until the notes were finished , drying their feet at the furnaces , and sheltering their faces from the intolerable heat .

		At last the overseer concluded with -- `` I believe that is a pretty fair estimate , Captain . ''

		`` Here , some of you men ! ''

		said
Kirby	PERSON	, `` bring up those boards .

		We may as well sit down , gentlemen , until the rain is over .

		It can not last much longer at this rate . ''

		`` Pig-metal , '' -- mumbled the reporter , -- `` um !

		coal facilities , -- um !

		hands employed , twelve hundred , -- bitumen , -- um !

		-- all right , I believe , Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	; -- sinking-fund , -- what did you say was your sinking-fund ? ''

		`` Twelve hundred hands ? ''

		said the stranger , the young man who had first spoken .

		`` Do you control their votes ,
Kirby	PERSON	? ''

		`` Control ?

		No . ''

		The young man smiled complacently .

		`` But my father brought seven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November .

		No force-work , you understand , -- only a speech or two , a hint to form themselves into a society , and a bit of red and blue bunting to make them a flag .

		The Invincible Roughs , -- I believe that is their name .

		I forget the motto : ` Our country 's hope , ' I think . ''

		There was a laugh .

		The young man talking to
Kirby	PERSON	sat with an amused light in his cool gray eye , surveying critically the half-clothed figures of the puddlers , and the slow swing of their brawny muscles .

		He was a stranger in the city , -- spending a couple of months in the borders of a Slave State , to study the institutions of the South , -- a brother-in-law of
Kirby	PERSON	's , --
Mitchell	PERSON	.

		He was an amateur gymnast , -- hence his anatomical eye ; a patron , in a blase ' way , of the prize-ring ; a man who sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent , gentlemanly way ; who took
Kant	PERSON	, Novalis ,
Humboldt	PERSON	, for what they were worth in his own scales ; accepting all , despising nothing , in heaven , earth , or hell , but one-idead men ; with a temper yielding and brilliant as summer water , until his Self was touched , when it was ice , though brilliant still .

		Such men are not rare in the
States	LOCATION	.

		As he knocked the ashes from his cigar ,
Wolfe	PERSON	caught with a quick pleasure the contour of the white hand , the blood-glow of a red ring he wore .

		His voice , too , and that of
Kirby	PERSON	's , touched him like music , -- low , even , with chording cadences .

		About this man
Mitchell	PERSON	hung the impalpable atmosphere belonging to the thoroughbred gentleman ,
Wolfe	PERSON	, scraping away the ashes beside him , was conscious of it , did obeisance to it with his artist sense , unconscious that he did so .

		The rain did not cease .


Clarke	PERSON	and the reporter left the mills ; the others , comfortably seated near the furnace , lingered , smoking and talking in a desultory way .

		Greek would not have been more unintelligible to the furnace-tenders , whose presence they soon forgot entirely .


Kirby	PERSON	drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some article , which they discussed eagerly .

		At every sentence ,
Wolfe	PERSON	listened more and more like a dumb , hopeless animal , with a duller , more stolid look creeping over his face , glancing now and then at
Mitchell	ORGANIZATION	, marking acutely every smallest sign of refinement , then back to himself , seeing as in a mirror his filthy body , his more stained soul .

		Never !

		He had no words for such a thought , but he knew now , in all the sharpness of the bitter certainty , that between them there was a great gulf never to be passed .

		Never !

		The bell of the mills rang for midnight .

		Sunday morning had dawned .

		Whatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men unknown .

		Yet it was there .

		Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen
Saviour	PERSON	was a key-note to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone wrong , -- even this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler grappled with madly to-night .

		The men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons .

		The mills were deserted on Sundays , except by the hands who fed the fires , and those who had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps .

		The three strangers sat still during the next hour , watching the men cover the furnaces , laughing now and then at some jest of
Kirby	PERSON	's .

		`` Do you know , '' said
Mitchell	PERSON	, `` I like this view of the works better than when the glare was fiercest ?

		These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre of smothered fires are ghostly , unreal .

		One could fancy these red smouldering lights to be the half-shut eyes of wild beasts , and the spectral figures their victims in the den . ''


Kirby	PERSON	laughed .

		`` You are fanciful .

		Come , let us get out of the den .

		The spectral figures , as you call them , are a little too real for me to fancy a close proximity in the darkness , -- unarmed , too . ''

		The others rose , buttoning their overcoats , and lighting cigars .

		`` Raining , still , '' said Doctor May , `` and hard .

		Where did we leave the coach ,
Mitchell	PERSON	? ''

		`` At the other side of the works .


-- Kirby	PERSON	, what 's that ? ''


Mitchell	PERSON	started back , half-frightened , as , suddenly turning a corner , the white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness , -- a woman , white , of giant proportions , crouching on the ground , her arms flung out in some wild gesture of warning .

		`` Stop !

		Make that fire burn there ! ''

		cried
Kirby	PERSON	, stopping short .

		The flame burst out , flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief .


Mitchell	PERSON	drew a long breath .

		`` I thought it was alive , '' he said , going up curiously .

		The others followed .

		`` Not marble , eh ? ''

		asked
Kirby	PERSON	, touching it .

		One of the lower overseers stopped .

		`` Korl , Sir . ''

		`` Who did it ? ''

		`` Ca n't say .

		Some of the hands ; chipped it out in off-hours . ''

		`` Chipped to some purpose , I should say .

		What a flesh-tint the stuff has !

		Do you see ,
Mitchell	PERSON	? ''

		`` I see . ''

		He had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure , looking at it in silence .

		There was not one line of beauty or grace in it : a nude woman 's form , muscular , grown coarse with labor , the powerful limbs instinct with some one poignant longing .

		One idea : there it was in the tense , rigid muscles , the clutching hands , the wild , eager face , like that of a starving wolf 's .


Kirby	PERSON	and Doctor May walked around it , critical , curious .


Mitchell	PERSON	stood aloof , silent .

		The figure touched him strangely .

		`` Not badly done , '' said Doctor May , `` Where did the fellow learn that sweep of the muscles in the arm and hand ?

		Look at them !

		They are groping , do you see ?

		-- clutching : the peculiar action of a man dying of thirst . ''

		`` They have ample facilities for studying anatomy , '' sneered
Kirby	PERSON	, glancing at the half-naked figures .

		`` Look , '' continued the Doctor , `` at this bony wrist , and the strained sinews of the instep !

		A working-woman , -- the very type of her class . ''

		`` God forbid ! ''

		muttered
Mitchell	PERSON	.

		`` Why ? ''

		demanded May , `` What does the fellow intend by the figure ?

		I can not catch the meaning . ''

		`` Ask him , '' said the other , dryly , `` There he stands , '' -- pointing to
Wolfe	PERSON	, who stood with a group of men , leaning on his ash-rake .

		The Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men put on , when talking to these people .

		`` Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	has picked you out as the man who did this , -- I 'm sure I do n't know why .

		But what did you mean by it ? ''

		`` She be hungry . ''


Wolfe	PERSON	's eyes answered
Mitchell	PERSON	, not the Doctor .

		`` Oh-h !

		But what a mistake you have made , my fine fellow !

		You have given no sign of starvation to the body .

		It is strong , -- terribly strong .

		It has the mad , half-despairing gesture of drowning . ''


Wolfe	PERSON	stammered , glanced appealingly at
Mitchell	ORGANIZATION	, who saw the soul of the thing , he knew .

		But the cool , probing eyes were turned on himself now , -- mocking , cruel , relentless .

		`` Not hungry for meat , '' the furnace-tender said at last .

		`` What then ?

		Whiskey ? ''

		jeered
Kirby	PERSON	, with a coarse laugh .


Wolfe	PERSON	was silent a moment , thinking .

		`` I dunno , '' he said , with a bewildered look .

		`` It mebbe .

		Summat to make her live , I think , -- like you .

		Whiskey ull do it , in a way . ''

		The young man laughed again .


Mitchell	PERSON	flashed a look of disgust somewhere , -- not at
Wolfe	PERSON	.

		`` May , '' he broke out impatiently , `` are you blind ?

		Look at that woman 's face !

		It asks questions of God , and says , ' I have a right to know , ' Good God , how hungry it is ! ''

		They looked a moment ; then May turned to the mill-owner : -- `` Have you many such hands as this ?

		What are you going to do with them ?

		Keep them at puddling iron ? ''


Kirby	PERSON	shrugged his shoulders .


Mitchell	PERSON	's look had irritated him .

		`` Ce n'est pas mon affaire .

		I have no fancy for nursing infant geniuses .

		I suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among these wretches .

		The Lord will take care of his own ; or else they can work out their own salvation .

		I have heard you call our American system a ladder which any man can scale .

		Do you doubt it ?

		Or perhaps you want to banish all social ladders , and put us all on a flat table-land , -- eh , May ? ''

		The Doctor looked vexed , puzzled .

		Some terrible problem lay hid in this woman 's face , and troubled these men .


Kirby	PERSON	waited for an answer , and , receiving none , went on , warming with his subject .

		`` I tell you , there 's something wrong that no talk of ` Liberte ' or ` Egalite ' will do away .

		If I had the making of men , these men who do the lowest part of the world 's work should be machines , -- nothing more , -- hands .

		It would be kindness .

		God help them !

		What are taste , reason , to creatures who must live such lives as that ? ''

		He pointed to
Deborah	PERSON	, sleeping on the ash-heap .

		`` So many nerves to sting them to pain .

		What if
God	PERSON	had put your brain , with all its agony of touch , into your fingers , and bid you work and strike with that ? ''

		`` You think you could govern the world better ? ''

		laughed the Doctor .

		`` I do not think at all . ''

		`` That is true philosophy .

		Drift with the stream , because you can not dive deep enough to find bottom , eh ? ''

		`` Exactly , '' rejoined
Kirby	PERSON	.

		`` I do not think .

		I wash my hands of all social problems , -- slavery , caste , white or black .

		My duty to my operatives has a narrow limit , -- the pay-hour on Saturday night .

		Outside of that , if they cut korl , or cut each other 's throats , -LRB- the more popular amusement of the two , -RRB- I am not responsible . ''

		The Doctor sighed , -- a good honest sigh , from the depths of his stomach .

		`` God help us !

		Who is responsible ? ''

		`` Not I , I tell you , '' said
Kirby	PERSON	, testily .

		`` What has the man who pays them money to do with their souls ' concerns , more than the grocer or butcher who takes it ? ''

		`` And yet , '' said
Mitchell	PERSON	's cynical voice , `` look at her !

		How hungry she is ! ''


Kirby	PERSON	tapped his boot with his cane .

		No one spoke .

		Only the dumb face of the rough image looking into their faces with the awful question , `` What shall we do to be saved ? ''

		Only
Wolfe	PERSON	's face , with its heavy weight of brain , its weak , uncertain mouth , its desperate eyes , out of which looked the soul of his class , -- only
Wolfe	PERSON	's face turned towards
Kirby	PERSON	's .


Mitchell	PERSON	laughed , -- a cool , musical laugh .

		`` Money has spoken ! ''

		he said , seating himself lightly on a stone with the air of an amused spectator at a play .

		`` Are you answered ? ''

		-- turning to
Wolfe	PERSON	his clear , magnetic face .

		Bright and deep and cold as Arctic air , the soul of the man lay tranquil beneath .

		He looked at the furnace-tender as he had looked at a rare mosaic in the morning ; only the man was the more amusing study of the two .

		`` Are you answered ?

		Why , May , look at him !

		` De profundis clamavi . '

		Or , to quote in English , ` Hungry and thirsty , his soul faints in him . '

		And so Money sends back its answer into the depths through you ,
Kirby	PERSON	!

		Very clear the answer , too !

		-- I think I remember reading the same words somewhere : washing your hands in
Eau de Cologne	LOCATION	, and saying , ' I am innocent of the blood of this man .

		See ye to it ! ' ''


Kirby	PERSON	flushed angrily .

		`` You quote Scripture freely . ''

		`` Do I not quote correctly ?

		I think I remember another line , which may amend my meaning ?

		` Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these , ye did it unto me . '

		Deist ?

		Bless you , man , I was raised on the milk of the Word .

		Now , Doctor , the pocket of the world having uttered its voice , what has the heart to say ?

		You are a philanthropist , in a small Way , -- n'est ce pas ?

		Here , boy , this gentleman can show you how to cut korl better , -- or your destiny .

		Go on , May ! ''

		`` I think a mocking devil possesses you to-night , '' rejoined the Doctor , seriously .

		He went to
Wolfe	PERSON	and put his hand kindly on his arm .

		Something of a vague idea possessed the Doctor 's brain that much good was to be done here by a friendly word or two : a latent genius to be warmed into life by a waited-for sunbeam .

		Here it was : he had brought it .

		So he went on complacently : `` Do you know , boy , you have it in you to be a great sculptor , a great man ?

		do you understand ? ''

		-LRB- talking down to the capacity of his hearer : it is a way people have with children , and men like
Wolfe	PERSON	, -RRB- -- `` to live a better , stronger life than I , or Mr.
Kirby	PERSON	here ?

		A man may make himself anything he chooses .

		God has given you stronger powers than many men , -- me , for instance . ''

		May stopped , heated , glowing with his own magnanimity .

		And it was magnanimous .

		The puddler had drunk in every word , looking through the Doctor 's flurry , and generous heat , and self-approval , into his will , with those slow , absorbing eyes of his .

		`` Make yourself what you will .

		It is your right .

		`` I know , '' quietly .

		`` Will you help me ? ''


Mitchell	PERSON	laughed again .

		The Doctor turned now , in a passion , -- `` You know ,
Mitchell	PERSON	, I have not the means .

		You know , if I had , it is in my heart to take this boy and educate him for '' -- `` The glory of God , and the glory of
John May	PERSON	. ''

		May did not speak for a moment ; then , controlled , he said , -- `` Why should one be raised , when myriads are left ?

		-- I have not the money , boy , '' to
Wolfe	PERSON	, shortly .

		`` Money ? ''

		He said it over slowly , as one repeats the guessed answer to a riddle , doubtfully .

		`` That is it ?

		Money ? ''

		`` Yes , money , -- that is it , '' said
Mitchell	PERSON	, rising , and drawing his furred coat about him .

		`` You 've found the cure for all the world 's diseases .

		-- Come , May , find your good-humor , and come home .

		This damp wind chills my very bones .

		Come and preach your Saint-Simonian doctrines ' to-morrow to
Kirby	PERSON	's hands .

		Let them have a clear idea of the rights of the soul , and I 'll venture next week they 'll strike for higher wages .

		That will be the end of it . ''

		`` Will you send the coach-driver to this side of the mills ? ''

		asked
Kirby	PERSON	, turning to
Wolfe	PERSON	.

		He spoke kindly : it was his habit to do so .


Deborah	PERSON	, seeing the puddler go , crept after him .

		The three men waited outside .

		Doctor May walked up and down , chafed .

		Suddenly he stopped .

		`` Go back ,
Mitchell	PERSON	!

		You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak without meaning to these people .

		What has its head to say ?

		Taste , culture , refinement ?

		Go ! ''


Mitchell	PERSON	was leaning against a brick wall .

		He turned his head indolently , and looked into the mills .

		There hung about the place a thick , unclean odor .

		The slightest motion of his hand marked that he perceived it , and his insufferable disgust .

		That was all .

		May said nothing , only quickened his angry tramp .

		`` Besides , '' added
Mitchell	PERSON	, giving a corollary to his answer , `` it would be of no use .

		I am not one of them . ''

		`` You do not mean '' -- said May , facing him .

		`` Yes , I mean just that .

		Reform is born of need , not pity .

		No vital movement of the people 's has worked down , for good or evil ; fermented , instead , carried up the heaving , cloggy mass .

		Think back through history , and you will know it .

		What will this lowest deep -- thieves ,
Magdalens	LOCATION	, negroes -- do with the light filtered through ponderous Church creeds , Baconian theories ,
Goethe	PERSON	schemes ?

		Some day , out of their bitter need will be thrown up their own light-bringer , -- their
Jean Paul	PERSON	, their Cromwell , their Messiah . ''

		`` Bah ! ''

		was the Doctor 's inward criticism .

		However , in practice , he adopted the theory ; for , when , night and morning , afterwards , he prayed that power might be given these degraded souls to rise , he glowed at heart , recognizing an accomplished duty .


Wolfe	PERSON	and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach drove off .

		The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank , generous way , telling him to `` take care of himself , and to remember it was his right to rise . ''


Mitchell	PERSON	had simply touched his hat , as to an equal , with a quiet look of thorough recognition .


Kirby	PERSON	had thrown
Deborah	PERSON	some money , which she found , and clutched eagerly enough .

		They were gone now , all of them .

		The man sat down on the cinder-road , looking up into the murky sky . '' '

		T be late ,
Hugh	PERSON	.

		Wunnot hur come ? ''

		He shook his head doggedly , and the woman crouched out of his sight against the wall .

		Do you remember rare moments when a sudden light flashed over yourself , your world , God ?

		when you stood on a mountain-peak , seeing your life as it might have been , as it is ?

		one quick instant , when custom lost its force and every-day usage ?

		when your friend , wife , brother , stood in a new light ?

		your soul was bared , and the grave , -- a foretaste of the nakedness of the Judgment-Day ?

		So it came before him , his life , that night .

		The slow tides of pain he had borne gathered themselves up and surged against his soul .

		His squalid daily life , the brutal coarseness eating into his brain , as the ashes into his skin : before , these things had been a dull aching into his consciousness ; to-night , they were reality .

		He griped the filthy red shirt that clung , stiff with soot , about him , and tore it savagely from his arm .

		The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashes , -- and the heart beneath that !

		And the soul ?

		God knows .

		Then flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left him , -- the pure face , the delicate , sinewy limbs , in harmony with all he knew of beauty or truth .

		In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something like this .

		He had found it in this
Mitchell	PERSON	, even when he idly scoffed at his pain : a Man all-knowing , all-seeing , crowned by Nature , reigning , -- the keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other men .

		And yet his instinct taught him that he too -- He !

		He looked at himself with sudden loathing , sick , wrung his hands With a cry , and then was silent .

		With all the phantoms of his heated , ignorant fancy ,
Wolfe	PERSON	had not been vague in his ambitions .

		They were practical , slowly built up before him out of his knowledge of what he could do .

		Through years he had day by day made this hope a real thing to himself , -- a clear , projected figure of himself , as he might become .

		Able to speak , to know what was best , to raise these men and women working at his side up with him : sometimes he forgot this defined hope in the frantic anguish to escape , only to escape , -- out of the wet , the pain , the ashes , somewhere , anywhere , -- only for one moment of free air on a hill-side , to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in the sunshine .

		But to-night he panted for life .

		The savage strength of his nature was roused ; his cry was fierce to God for justice .

		`` Look at me ! ''

		he said to
Deborah	PERSON	, with a low , bitter laugh , striking his puny chest savagely .

		`` What am I worth ,
Deb	PERSON	?

		Is it my fault that I am no better ?

		My fault ?

		My fault ? ''

		He stopped , stung with a sudden remorse , seeing her hunchback shape writhing with sobs .

		For
Deborah	PERSON	was crying thankless tears , according to the fashion of women .

		`` God forgi ' me , woman !

		Things go harder Wi ' you nor me .

		It 's a worse share . ''

		He got up and helped her to rise ; and they went doggedly down the muddy street , side by side .

		`` It 's all wrong , '' he muttered , slowly , -- `` all wrong !

		I dunnot understan ' .

		But it 'll end some day . ''

		`` Come home ,
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		she said , coaxingly ; for he had stopped , looking around bewildered .

		`` Home , -- and back to the mill ! ''

		He went on saying this over to himself , as if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair .

		She followed him through the fog , her blue lips chattering with cold .

		They reached the cellar at last .

		Old
Wolfe	PERSON	had been drinking since she went out , and had crept nearer the door .

		The girl
Janey	PERSON	slept heavily in the corner .

		He went up to her , touching softly the worn white arm with his fingers .

		Some bitterer thought stung him , as he stood there .

		He wiped the drops from his forehead , and went into the room beyond , livid , trembling .

		A hope , trifling , perhaps , but very dear , had died just then out of the poor puddler 's life , as he looked at the sleeping , innocent girl , -- some plan for the future , in which she had borne a part .

		He gave it up that moment , then and forever .

		Only a trifle , perhaps , to us : his face grew a shade paler , -- that was all .

		But , somehow , the man 's soul , as God and the angels looked down on it , never was the same afterwards .


Deborah	PERSON	followed him into the inner room .

		She carried a candle , which she placed on the floor , closing the door after her .

		She had seen the look on his face , as he turned away : her own grew deadly .

		Yet , as she came up to him , her eyes glowed .

		He was seated on an old chest , quiet , holding his face in his hands .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		she said , softly .

		He did not speak .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	, did hur hear what the man said , -- him with the clear voice ?

		Did hur hear ?

		Money , money , -- that it wud do all ? ''

		He pushed her away , -- gently , but he was worn out ; her rasping tone fretted him .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		The candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls , and the woman standing there .

		He looked at her .

		She was young , in deadly earnest ; her faded eyes , and wet , ragged figure caught from their frantic eagerness a power akin to beauty .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	, it is true !

		Money ull do it !

		Oh ,
Hugh	PERSON	, boy , listen till me !

		He said it true !

		It is money ! ''

		`` I know .

		Go back !

		I do not want you here . ''

		``
Hugh	PERSON	, it is t ' last time .

		I 'll never worrit hur again . ''

		There were tears in her voice now , but she choked them back : `` Hear till me only to-night !

		If one of t ' witch people wud come , them we heard oft ' home , and gif hur all hur wants , what then ?

		Say ,
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		`` What do you mean ? ''

		`` I mean money . ''

		Her whisper shrilled through his brain .

		`` If one oft ' witch dwarfs wud come from t ' lane moors to-night , and gif hur money , to go out , -- OUT , I say , -- out , lad , where t ' sun shines , and t ' heath grows , and t ' ladies walk in silken gownds , and God stays all t ' time , -- where t ` man lives that talked to us to-night ,
Hugh	PERSON	knows , --
Hugh	PERSON	could walk there like a king ! ''

		He thought the woman mad , tried to check her , but she went on , fierce in her eager haste .

		`` If I were t ' witch dwarf , if I had t ' money , wud hur thank me ?

		Wud hur take me out o ' this place wid hur and
Janey	PERSON	?

		I wud not come into the gran ' house hur wud build , to vex hur wid t ' hunch , -- only at night , when t ' shadows were dark , stand far off to see hur . ''

		Mad ?

		Yes !

		Are many of us mad in this way ?

		`` Poor
Deb	PERSON	!

		poor
Deb	PERSON	! ''

		he said , soothingly .

		`` It is here , '' she said , suddenly , jerking into his hand a small roll .

		`` I took it !

		I did it !

		Me , me !

		-- not hur !

		I shall be hanged , I shall be burnt in hell , if anybody knows I took it !

		Out of his pocket , as he leaned against t ' bricks .

		Hur knows ? ''

		She thrust it into his hand , and then , her errand done , began to gather chips together to make a fire , choking down hysteric sobs .

		`` Has it come to this ? ''

		That was all he said .

		The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest .

		The roll was a small green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces , and a check for an incredible amount , as it seemed to the poor puddler .

		He laid it down , hiding his face again in his hands .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	, do n't be angry wud me !

		It 's only poor
Deb	PERSON	, -- hur knows ? ''

		He took the long skinny fingers kindly in his .

		`` Angry ?

		God help me , no !

		Let me sleep .

		I am tired . ''

		He threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench , stunned with pain and weariness .

		She brought some old rags to cover him .

		It was late on Sunday evening before he awoke .

		I tell God 's truth , when I say he had then no thought of keeping this money .


Deborah	PERSON	had hid it in his pocket .

		He found it there .

		She watched him eagerly , as he took it out .

		`` I must gif it to him , '' he said , reading her face .

		`` Hur knows , '' she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment .

		`` But it is hur right to keep it . ''

		His right !

		The word struck him .

		Doctor May had used the same .

		He washed himself , and went out to find this man
Mitchell	PERSON	.

		His right !

		Why did this chance word cling to him so obstinately ?

		Do you hear the fierce devils whisper in his ear , as he went slowly down the darkening street ?

		The evening came on , slow and calm .

		He seated himself at the end of an alley leading into one of the larger streets .

		His brain was clear to-night , keen , intent , mastering .

		It would not start back , cowardly , from any hellish temptation , but meet it face to face .

		Therefore the great temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry , but bold , defiant , owning its own vile name , trusting to one bold blow for victory .

		He did not deceive himself .

		Theft !

		That was it .

		At first the word sickened him ; then he grappled with it .

		Sitting there on a broken cart-wheel , the fading day , the noisy groups , the church-bells ' tolling passed before him like a panorama , while the sharp struggle went on within .

		This money !

		He took it out , and looked at it .

		If he gave it back , what then ?

		He was going to be cool about it .

		People going by to church saw only a sickly mill-boy watching them quietly at the alley 's mouth .

		They did not know that he was mad , or they would not have gone by so quietly : mad with hunger ; stretching out his hands to the world , that had given so much to them , for leave to live the life God meant him to live .

		His soul within him was smothering to death ; he wanted so much , thought so much , and knew -- nothing .

		There was nothing of which he was certain , except the mill and things there .

		Of God and heaven he had heard so little , that they were to him what fairy-land is to a child : something real , but not here ; very far off .

		His brain , greedy , dwarfed , full of thwarted energy and unused powers , questioned these men and women going by , coldly , bitterly , that night .

		Was it not his right to live as they , -- a pure life , a good , true-hearted life , full of beauty and kind words ?

		He only wanted to know how to use the strength within him .

		His heart warmed , as he thought of it .

		He suffered himself to think of it longer .

		If he took the money ?

		Then he saw himself as he might be , strong , helpful , kindly .

		The night crept on , as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of other thoughts and stood triumphant .

		He looked at it .

		As he might be !

		What wonder , if it blinded him to delirium , -- the madness that underlies all revolution , all progress , and all fall ?

		You laugh at the shallow temptation ?

		You see the error underlying its argument so clearly , -- that to him a true life was one of full development rather than self-restraint ?

		that he was deaf to the higher tone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truth 's sake than in the fullest flow of spontaneous harmony ?

		I do not plead his cause .

		I only want to show you the mote in my brother 's eye : then you can see clearly to take it out .

		The money , -- there it lay on his knee , a little blotted slip of paper , nothing in itself ; used to raise him out of the pit , something straight from God 's hand .

		A thief !

		Well , what was it to be a thief ?

		He met the question at last , face to face , wiping the clammy drops of sweat from his forehead .

		God made this money -- the fresh air , too -- for his children 's use .

		He never made the difference between poor and rich .

		The Something who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky had a kindly face , he knew , -- loved his children alike .

		Oh , he knew that !

		There were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple flames , or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge , had somehow given him a glimpse of another world than this , -- of an infinite depth of beauty and of quiet somewhere , -- somewhere , a depth of quiet and rest and love .

		Looking up now , it became strangely real .

		The sun had sunk quite below the hills , but his last rays struck upward , touching the zenith .

		The fog had risen , and the town and river were steeped in its thick , gray damp ; but overhead , the sun-touched smoke-clouds opened like a cleft ocean , -- shifting , rolling seas of crimson mist , waves of billowy silver veined with blood-scarlet , inner depths unfathomable of glancing light .


Wolfe	PERSON	's artist-eye grew drunk with color .

		The gates of that other world !

		Fading , flashing before him now !

		What , in that world of Beauty , Content , and Right , were the petty laws , the mine and thine , of mill-owners and mill hands ?

		A consciousness of power stirred within him .

		He stood up .

		A man , -- he thought , stretching out his hands , -- free to work , to live , to love !

		Free !

		His right !

		He folded the scrap of paper in his hand .

		As his nervous fingers took it in , limp and blotted , so his soul took in the mean temptation , lapped it in fancied rights , in dreams of improved existences , drifting and endless as the cloud-seas of color .

		Clutching it , as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of possession , he went aimlessly down the street .

		It was his watch at the mill .

		He need not go , need never go again , thank God !

		-- shaking off the thought with unspeakable loathing .

		Shall I go over the history of the hours of that night ?

		how the man wandered from one to another of his old haunts , with a half-consciousness of bidding them farewell , -- lanes and alleys and back-yards where the mill-hands lodged , -- noting , with a new eagerness , the filth and drunkenness , the pig-pens , the ash-heaps covered with potato-skins , the bloated , pimpled women at the doors , with a new disgust , a new sense of sudden triumph , and , under all , a new , vague dread , unknown before , smothered down , kept under , but still there ?

		It left him but once during the night , when , for the second time in his life , he entered a church .

		It was a sombre Gothic pile , where the stained light lost itself in far-retreating arches ; built to meet the requirements and sympathies of a far other class than
Wolfe	PERSON	's .

		Yet it touched , moved him uncontrollably .

		The distances , the shadows , the still , marble figures , the mass of silent kneeling worshippers , the mysterious music , thrilled , lifted his soul with a wonderful pain .


Wolfe	PERSON	forgot himself , forgot the new life he was going to live , the mean terror gnawing underneath .

		The voice of the speaker strengthened the charm ; it was clear , feeling , full , strong .

		An old man , who had lived much , suffered much ; whose brain was keenly alive , dominant ; whose heart was summer-warm with charity .

		He taught it to-night .

		He held up Humanity in its grand total ; showed the great world-cancer to his people .

		Who could show it better ?

		He was a Christian reformer ; he had studied the age thoroughly ; his outlook at man had been free , world-wide , over all time .

		His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages ; his fiery zeal guided vast schemes by which the Gospel was to be preached to all nations .

		How did he preach it to-night ?

		In burning , light-laden words he painted
Jesus	PERSON	, the incarnate Life , Love , the universal Man : words that became reality in the lives of these people , -- that lived again in beautiful words and actions , trifling , but heroic .

		Sin , as he defined it , was a real foe to them ; their trials , temptations , were his .

		His words passed far over the furnace-tender 's grasp , toned to suit another class of culture ; they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an unknown tongue .

		He meant to cure this world-cancer with a steady eye that had never glared with hunger , and a hand that neither poverty nor strychnine-whiskey had taught to shake .

		In this morbid , distorted heart of the Welsh puddler he had failed .

		Eighteen centuries ago , the Master of this man tried reform in the streets of a city as crowded and vile as this , and did not fail .

		His disciple , showing Him to-night to cultured hearers , showing the clearness of the God-power acting through Him , shrank back from one coarse fact ; that in birth and habit the man
Christ	PERSON	was thrown up from the lowest of the people : his flesh , their flesh ; their blood , his blood ; tempted like them , to brutalize day by day ; to lie , to steal : the actual slime and want of their hourly life , and the wine-press he trod alone .

		Yet , is there no meaning in this perpetually covered truth ?

		If the son of the carpenter had stood in the church that night , as he stood with the fishermen and harlots by the sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	, before His Father and their Father , despised and rejected of men , without a place to lay His head , wounded for their iniquities , bruised for their transgressions , would not that hungry mill-boy at least , in the back seat , have `` known the man '' ?

		That
Jesus	PERSON	did not stand there .


Wolfe	PERSON	rose at last , and turned from the church down the street .

		He looked up ; the night had come on foggy , damp ; the golden mists had vanished , and the sky lay dull and ash-colored .

		He wandered again aimlessly down the street , idly wondering what had become of the cloud-sea of crimson and scarlet .

		The trial-day of this man 's life was over , and he had lost the victory .

		What followed was mere drifting circumstance , -- a quicker walking over the path , -- that was all .

		Do you want to hear the end of it ?

		You wish me to make a tragic story out of it ?

		Why , in the police-reports of the morning paper you can find a dozen such tragedies : hints of shipwrecks unlike any that ever befell on the high seas ; hints that here a power was lost to heaven , -- that there a soul went down where no tide can ebb or flow .

		Commonplace enough the hints are , -- jocose sometimes , done up in rhyme .

		Doctor May a month after the night I have told you of , was reading to his wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morning-paper : an unusual thing , -- these police-reports not being , in general , choice reading for ladies ; but it was only one item he read .

		`` Oh , my dear !

		You remember that man I told you of , that we saw at
Kirby	PERSON	's mill ?

		-- that was arrested for robbing
Mitchell	PERSON	?

		Here he is ; just listen : -- `
Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		Judge Day .


Hugh Wolfe	PERSON	, operative in
Kirby & John	ORGANIZATION	's
Loudon Mills	LOCATION	.

		Charge , grand larceny .

		Sentence , nineteen years hard labor in penitentiary .

		Scoundrel !

		Serves him right !

		After all our kindness that night !

		Picking
Mitchell	PERSON	's pocket at the very time ! ''

		His wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people , and then they began to talk of something else .

		Nineteen years !

		How easy that was to read !

		What a simple word for Judge Day to utter !

		Nineteen years !

		Half a lifetime !


Hugh Wolfe	PERSON	sat on the window-ledge of his cell , looking out .

		His ankles Were ironed .

		Not usual in such cases ; but he had made two desperate efforts to escape .

		`` Well , '' as
Haley	PERSON	, the jailer , said , `` small blame to him !

		Nineteen years ' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look forward to . ''


Haley	PERSON	was very good-natured about it , though
Wolfe	PERSON	had fought him savagely .

		`` When he was first caught , '' the jailer said afterwards , in telling the story , `` before the trial , the fellow was cut down at once , -- laid there on that pallet like a dead man , with his hands over his eyes .

		Never saw a man so cut down in my life .

		Time of the trial , too , came the queerest dodge of any customer I ever had .

		Would choose no lawyer .

		Judge gave him one , of course .


Gibson	PERSON	it Was .

		He tried to prove the fellow crazy ; but it would n't go .

		Thing was plain as daylight : money found on him . '

		T was a hard sentence , -- all the law allows ; but it was for ` xample 's sake .

		These mill-hands are gettin ' onbearable .

		When the sentence was read , he just looked up , and said the money was his by rights , and that all the world had gone wrong .

		That night , after the trial , a gentleman came to see him here , name of
Mitchell	PERSON	, -- him as he stole from .

		Talked to him for an hour .

		Thought he came for curiosity , like .

		After he was gone , thought
Wolfe	PERSON	was remarkable quiet , and went into his cell .

		Found him very low ; bed all bloody .

		Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs .

		He was as weak as a cat ; yet if ye 'll b ` lieve me , he tried to get a-past me and get out .

		I just carried him like a baby , and threw him on the pallet .

		Three days after , he tried it again : that time reached the wall .

		Lord help you !

		he fought like a tiger , -- giv ' some terrible blows .

		Fightin ' for life , you see ; for he ca n't live long , shut up in the stone crib down yonder .

		Got a death-cough now . '

		T took two of us to bring him down that day ; so I just put the irons on his feet .

		There he sits , in there .

		Goin ' to-morrow , with a batch more of 'em .

		That woman , hunchback , tried with him , -- you remember ?

		-- she 's only got three years .

		` Complice .

		But she 's a woman , you know .

		He 's been quiet ever since I put on irons : giv ' up , I suppose .

		Looks white , sick-lookin ' .

		It acts different on 'em , bein ' sentenced .

		Most of 'em gets reckless , devilish-like .

		Some prays awful , and sings them vile songs of the mills , all in a breath .

		That woman , now , she 's desper ` t ' .

		Been beggin ' to see
Hugh	PERSON	, as she calls him , for three days .

		I 'm a-goin ' to let her in .

		She do n't go with him .

		Here she is in this next cell .

		I 'm a-goin ' now to let her in . ''

		He let her in .


Wolfe	PERSON	did not see her .

		She crept into a corner of the cell , and stood watching him .

		He was scratching the iron bars of the window with a piece of tin which he had picked up , with an idle , uncertain , vacant stare , just as a child or idiot would do .

		`` Tryin ' to get out , old boy ? ''

		laughed
Haley	PERSON	.

		`` Them irons will need a crow-bar beside your tin , before you can open 'em . ''


Wolfe	PERSON	laughed , too , in a senseless way .

		`` I think I 'll get out , '' he said .

		`` I believe his brain 's touched , '' said
Haley	PERSON	, when he came out .

		The puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour .

		Still
Deborah	PERSON	did not speak .

		At last she ventured nearer , and touched his arm .

		`` Blood ? ''

		she said , looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder .

		He looked up at her , `` Why ,
Deb	PERSON	! ''

		he said , smiling , -- such a bright , boyish smile , that it Went to poor
Deborah	PERSON	's heart directly , and she sobbed and cried out loud .

		`` Oh ,
Hugh	PERSON	, lad !


Hugh	PERSON	!

		dunnot look at me , when it wur my fault !

		To think I brought hur to it !

		And I loved hur so !

		Oh lad , I dud ! ''

		The confession , even In this wretch , came with the woman 's blush through the sharp cry .

		He did not seem to hear her , -- scraping away diligently at the bars with the bit of tin .

		Was he going mad ?

		She peered closely into his face .

		Something she saw there made her draw suddenly back , -- something which
Haley	PERSON	had not seen , that lay beneath the pinched , vacant look it had caught since the trial , or the curious gray shadow that rested on it .

		That gray shadow , -- yes , she knew what that meant .

		She had often seen it creeping over women 's faces for months , who died at last of slow hunger or consumption .

		That meant death , distant , lingering : but this -- Whatever it was the woman saw , or thought she saw , used as she was to crime and misery , seemed to make her sick with a new horror .

		Forgetting her fear of him , she caught his shoulders , and looked keenly , steadily , into his eyes .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		she cried , in a desperate whisper , -- `` oh , boy , not that !

		for God 's sake , not that ! ''

		The vacant laugh went off his face , and he answered her in a muttered word or two that drove her away .

		Yet the words were kindly enough .

		Sitting there on his pallet , she cried silently a hopeless sort of tears , but did not speak again .

		The man looked up furtively at her now and then .

		Whatever his own trouble was , her distress vexed him with a momentary sting .

		It was market-day .

		The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on the carts and wagons drawn up in a long line , where they had unloaded .

		He could see , too , and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed hands , the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving , pushing one another , and the chaffering and swearing at the stalls .

		Somehow , the sound , more than anything else had done , wakened him up , -- made the whole real to him .

		He was done with the world and the business of it .

		He let the tin fall , and looked out , pressing his face close to the rusty bars .

		How they crowded and pushed !

		And he , -- he should never walk that pavement again !

		There came
Neff Sanders	PERSON	, one of the feeders at the mill , with a basket on his arm .

		Sure enough ,
Nyeff	PERSON	was married the other week .

		He whistled , hoping he would look up ; but he did not .

		He wondered if
Neff	PERSON	remembered he was there , -- if any of the boys thought of him up there , and thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again .

		Never again !

		He had not quite understood it before ; but now he did .

		Not for days or years , but never !

		-- that was it .

		How clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market !

		and how like a picture it was , the dark-green heaps of corn , and the crimson beets , and golden melons !

		There was another with game : how the light flickered on that pheasant 's breast , with the purplish blood dripping over the brown feathers !

		He could see the red shining of the drops , it was so near .

		In one minute he could be down there .

		It was just a step .

		So easy , as it seemed , so natural to go !

		Yet it could never be -- not in all the thousands of years to come -- that he should put his foot on that street again !

		He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity , as of some one else .

		There was a dog down in the market , walking after his master with such a stately , grave look !

		-- only a dog , yet he could go backwards and forwards just as he pleased : he had good luck !

		Why , the very vilest cur , yelping there in the gutter , had not lived his life , had been free to act out whatever thought God had put into his brain ; while he -- No , he would not think of that !

		He tried to put the thought away , and to listen to a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat ; but it would come back .

		He , what had he done to bear this ?

		Then came the sudden picture of what might have been , and now .

		He knew what it was to be in the penitentiary , how it went with men there .

		He knew how in these long years he should slowly die , but not until soul and body had become corrupt and rotten , -- how , when he came out , if he lived to come , even the lowest of the mill-hands would jeer him , -- how his hands would be weak , and his brain senseless and stupid .

		He believed he was almost that now .

		He put his hand to his head , with a puzzled , weary look .

		It ached , his head , with thinking .

		He tried to quiet himself .

		It was only right , perhaps ; he had done wrong .

		But was there right or wrong for such as he ?

		What was right ?

		And who had ever taught him ?

		He thrust the whole matter away .

		A dark , cold quiet crept through his brain .

		It was all wrong ; but let it be !

		It was nothing to him more than the others .

		Let it be !

		The door grated , as
Haley	PERSON	opened it .

		`` Come , my woman !

		Must lock up for t ' night .

		Come , stir yerself ! ''

		She went up and took
Hugh	PERSON	's hand .

		`` Good-night ,
Deb	PERSON	, '' he said , carelessly .

		She had not hoped he would say more ; but the tired pain on her mouth just then was bitterer than death .

		She took his passive hand and kissed it .

		`` Hur 'll never see
Deb	PERSON	again ! ''

		she ventured , her lips growing colder and more bloodless .

		What did she say that for ?

		Did he not know it ?

		Yet he would not be impatient with poor old
Deb	PERSON	.

		She had trouble of her own , as well as he .

		`` No , never again , '' he said , trying to be cheerful .

		She stood just a moment , looking at him .

		Do you laugh at her , standing there , with her hunchback , her rags , her bleared , withered face , and the great despised love tugging at her heart ?

		`` Come , you ! ''

		called
Haley	PERSON	, impatiently .

		She did not move .

		``
Hugh	PERSON	! ''

		she whispered .

		It was to be her last word .

		What was it ?

		``
Hugh	PERSON	, boy , not THAT ! ''

		He did not answer .

		She wrung her hands , trying to be silent , looking in his face in an agony of entreaty .

		He smiled again , kindly .

		`` It is best ,
Deb	PERSON	.

		I can not bear to be hurted any more .

		`` Hur knows , '' she said , humbly .

		`` Tell my father good-bye ; and -- and kiss little
Janey	PERSON	. ''

		She nodded , saying nothing , looked in his face again , and went out of the door .

		As she went , she staggered .

		`` Drinkin ' to-day ? ''

		broke out
Haley	PERSON	, pushing her before him .

		`` Where the Devil did you get it ?

		Here , in with ye ! ''

		and he shoved her into her cell , next to
Wolfe	PERSON	's , and shut the door .

		Along the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor , through which she could see the light from
Wolfe	PERSON	's .

		She had discovered it days before .

		She hurried in now , and , kneeling down by it , listened , hoping to hear some sound .

		Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the bars .

		He was at his old amusement again .

		Something in the noise jarred on her ear , for she shivered as she heard it .


Hugh	PERSON	rasped away at the bars .

		A dull old bit of tin , not fit to cut korl with .

		He looked out of the window again .

		People were leaving the market now .

		A tall mulatto girl , following her mistress , her basket on her head , crossed the street just below , and looked up .

		She was laughing ; but , when she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars , suddenly grew grave , and hurried by .

		A free , firm step , a clear-cut olive face , with a scarlet turban tied on one side , dark , shining eyes , and on the head the basket poised , filled with fruit and flowers , under which the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half-shadowed .

		The picture caught his eye .

		It was good to see a face like that .

		He would try to-morrow , and cut one like it .

		To-morrow !

		He threw down the tin , trembling , and covered his face with his hands .

		When he looked up again , the daylight was gone .


Deborah	PERSON	, crouching near by on the other side of the wall , heard no noise .

		He sat on the side of the low pallet , thinking .

		Whatever was the mystery which the woman had seen on his face , it came out now slowly , in the dark there , and became fixed , -- a something never seen on his face before .

		The evening was darkening fast .

		The market had been over for an hour ; the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent : he listened to each , as it passed , because he thought it was to be for the last time .

		For the same reason , it was , I suppose , that he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of each passer-by , wondering who they were , what kind of homes they were going to , if they had children , -- listening eagerly to every chance word in the street , as if -- -LRB- God be merciful to the man !

		what strange fancy was this ? -RRB-

		-- as if he never should hear human voices again .

		It was quite dark at last .

		The street was a lonely one .

		The last passenger , he thought , was gone .

		No , -- there was a quick step :
Joe Hill	PERSON	, lighting the lamps .


Joe	PERSON	was a good old chap ; never passed a fellow without some joke or other .

		He remembered once seeing the place where he lived with his wife .

		`` Granny Hill '' the boys called her .

		Bedridden she Was ; but so kind as
Joe	PERSON	was to her !

		kept the room so clean !

		-- and the old woman , when he was there , was laughing at some of `` t ' lad 's foolishness . ''

		The step was far down the street ; but he could see him place the ladder , run up , and light the gas .

		A longing seized him to be spoken to once more .

		`` Joe ! ''

		he called , out of the grating .

		`` Good-bye ,
Joe	PERSON	! ''

		The old man stopped a moment , listening uncertainly ; then hurried on .

		The prisoner thrust his hand out of the window , and called again , louder ; but
Joe	PERSON	was too far down the street .

		It was a little thing ; but it hurt him , -- this disappointment .

		`` Good-bye ,
Joe	PERSON	! ''

		he called , sorrowfully enough .

		`` Be quiet ! ''

		said one of the jailers , passing the door , striking on it with his club .

		Oh , that was the last , was it ?

		There was an inexpressible bitterness on his face , as he lay down on the bed , taking the bit of tin , which he had rasped to a tolerable degree of sharpness , in his hand , -- to play with , it may be .

		He bared his arms , looking intently at their corded veins and sinews .


Deborah	PERSON	, listening in the next cell , heard a slight clicking sound , often repeated .

		She shut her lips tightly , that she might not scream ; the cold drops of sweat broke over her , in her dumb agony .

		`` Hur knows best , '' she muttered at last , fiercely clutching the boards where she lay .

		If she could have seen
Wolfe	PERSON	, there was nothing about him to frighten her .

		He lay quite still , his arms outstretched , looking at the pearly stream of moonlight coming into the window .

		I think in that one hour that came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before .

		I think that all the low , vile life , all his wrongs , all his starved hopes , came then , and stung him with a farewell poison that made him sick unto death .

		He made neither moan nor cry , only turned his worn face now and then to the pure light , that seemed so far off , as one that said , `` How long , O Lord ?

		how long ? ''

		The hour was over at last .

		The moon , passing over her nightly path , slowly came nearer , and threw the light across his bed on his feet .

		He watched it steadily , as it crept up , inch by inch , slowly .

		It seemed to him to carry with it a great silence .

		He had been so hot and tired there always in the mills !

		The years had been so fierce and cruel !

		There was coming now quiet and coolness and sleep .

		His tense limbs relaxed , and settled in a calm languor .

		The blood ran fainter and slow from his heart .

		He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was not ; he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him .

		At first he saw a sea of faces : the mill-men , -- women he had known , drunken and bloated , --
Janey	PERSON	's timid and pitiful-poor old Debs : then they floated together like a mist , and faded away , leaving only the clear , pearly moonlight .

		Whether , as the pure light crept up the stretched-out figure , it brought with It calm and peace , who shall say ?

		His dumb soul was alone with God in judgment .

		A
Voice	ORGANIZATION	may have spoken for it from far-off
Calvary	ORGANIZATION	, `` Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do ! ''

		Who dare say ?

		Fainter and fainter the heart rose and fell , slower and slower the moon floated from behind a cloud , until , when at last its full tide of white splendor swept over the cell , it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper stillness the dead figure that never should move again .

		Silence deeper than the Night !

		Nothing that moved , save the black , nauseous stream of blood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor !

		There was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day .

		The coroner and his jury , the local editors ,
Kirby	PERSON	himself , and boys with their hands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side , jammed into the corners .

		Coming and going all day .

		Only one woman .

		She came late , and outstayed them all .

		A
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, or Friend , as they call themselves .

		I think this woman Was known by that name in heaven .

		A homely body , coarsely dressed in gray and white .


Deborah	PERSON	-LRB- for
Haley	PERSON	had let her in -RRB- took notice of her .

		She watched them all -- sitting on the end of the pallet , holding his head in her arms with the ferocity of a watch-dog , if any of them touched the body .

		There was no meekness , no sorrow , in her face ; the stuff out of which murderers are made , instead .

		All the time
Haley	PERSON	and the woman were laying straight the limbs and cleaning the cell ,
Deborah	PERSON	sat still , keenly watching the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	's face .

		Of all the crowd there that day , this woman alone had not spoken to her , -- only once or twice had put some cordial to her lips .

		After they all were gone , the woman , in the same still , gentle way , brought a vase of wood-leaves and berries , and placed it by the pallet , then opened the narrow window .

		The fresh air blew in , and swept the woody fragrance over the dead face ,
Deborah	PERSON	looked up with a quick wonder .

		`` Did hur know my boy wud like it ?

		Did hur know
Hugh	PERSON	? ''

		`` I know
Hugh	PERSON	now . ''

		The white fingers passed in a slow , pitiful way over the dead , worn face .

		There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes .

		`` Did hur know where they 'll bury
Hugh	PERSON	? ''

		said
Deborah	PERSON	in a shrill tone , catching her arm .

		This had been the question hanging on her lips all day .

		`` In t ' town-yard ?

		Under t ' mud and ash ?

		T ' lad 'll smother , woman !

		He wur born in t ' lane moor , where t ' air is frick and strong .

		Take hur out , for God 's sake , take hur out where t ' air blows ! ''

		The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	hesitated , but only for a moment .

		She put her strong arm around
Deborah	PERSON	and led her to the window .

		`` Thee sees the hills , friend , over the river ?

		Thee sees how the light lies warm there , and the winds of God blow all the day ?

		I live there , -- where the blue smoke is , by the trees .

		Look at me , '' She turned
Deborah	PERSON	's face to her own , clear and earnest , `` Thee will believe me ?

		I will take
Hugh	PERSON	and bury him there to-morrow . ''


Deborah	PERSON	did not doubt her .

		As the evening wore on , she leaned against the iron bars , looking at the hills that rose far off , through the thick sodden clouds , like a bright , unattainable calm .

		As she looked , a shadow of their solemn repose fell on her face ; its fierce discontent faded into a pitiful , humble quiet .

		Slow , solemn tears gathered in her eyes : the poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where
Hugh	PERSON	was to rest , the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than ever before .

		The Quaker watched her keenly .

		She came to her at last , and touched her arm .

		`` When thee comes back , '' she said , in a low , sorrowful tone , like one who speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity , `` thee shall begin thy life again , -- there on the hills .

		I came too late ; but not for thee , -- by God 's help , it may be . ''

		Not too late .

		Three years after , the Quaker began her work .

		I end my story here .

		At evening-time it was light .

		There is no need to tire you with the long years of sunshine , and fresh air , and slow , patient Christ-love , needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and soul .

		There is a homely pine house , on one of these hills , whose windows overlook broad , wooded slopes and clover-crimsoned meadows , -- niched into the very place where the light is warmest , the air freest .

		It is the Friends ' meeting-house .

		Once a week they sit there , in their grave , earnest way , waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak , opening their simple hearts to receive His words .

		There is a woman , old , deformed , who takes a humble place among them : waiting like them : in her gray dress , her worn face , pure and meek , turned now and then to the sky .

		A woman much loved by these silent , restful people ; more silent than they , more humble , more loving .

		Waiting : with her eyes turned to hills higher and purer than these on which she lives , dim and far off now , but to be reached some day .

		There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet there the love denied her here , -- that she shall find him whom she lost , and that then she will not be all-unworthy .

		Who blames her ?

		Something is lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the other , -- something pure and beautiful , which might have been and was not : a hope , a talent , a love , over which the soul mourns , like
Esau	PERSON	deprived of his birthright .

		What blame to the meek
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, if she took her lost hope to make the hills of heaven more fair ?

		Nothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived , but this figure of the mill-woman cut in korl .

		I have it here in a corner of my library .

		I keep it hid behind a curtain , -- it is such a rough , ungainly thing .

		Yet there are about it touches , grand sweeps of outline , that show a master 's hand .

		Sometimes , -- to-night , for instance , -- the curtain is accidentally drawn back , and I see a bare arm stretched out imploringly in the darkness , and an eager , wolfish face watching mine : a wan , woful face , through which the spirit of the dead korl-cutter looks out , with its thwarted life , its mighty hunger , its unfinished work .

		Its pale , vague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question .

		`` Is this the End ? ''

		they say , -- `` nothing beyond ?

		no more ? ''

		Why , you tell me you have seen that look in the eyes of dumb brutes , -- horses dying under the lash .

		I know .

		The deep of the night is passing while I write .

		The gas-light wakens from the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through the room : only faintly , though ; for they belong to the open sunlight .

		As I glance at them , they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming day .

		A half-moulded child 's head ; Aphrodite ; a bough of forest-leaves ; music ; work ; homely fragments , in which lie the secrets of all eternal truth and beauty .

		Prophetic all !

		Only this dumb , woful face seems to belong to and end with the night .

		I turn to look at it .

		Has the power of its desperate need commanded the darkness away ?

		While the room is yet steeped in heavy shadow , a cool , gray light suddenly touches its head like a blessing hand , and its groping arm points through the broken cloud to the far
East	LOCATION	, where , in the flickering , nebulous crimson , God has set the promise of the Dawn .
