CHAPTER	NN

An	DT
Appeal	NN

As	RB

Richard	NNP
communicated	VBD
the	DT

I	PRP
doubt	VBP

altogether	RB
taken	VBN
by	IN

when	WRB

He	PRP

Richard	NNP
were	VBD
often	RB
closeted	VBN
together	RB
,	,
late	RB
at	IN

and	CC
early	RB
in	IN
the	DT

,	,
and	CC
passed	VBD
whole	JJ

London	NNP

had	VBD
innumerable	JJ

with	IN
Mr.	NNP
Kenge	NNP

laboured	VBD
through	IN
a	DT

While	IN

my	PRP$

though	IN
he	PRP
underwent	VBD
considerable	JJ

on	IN

And	CC
as	IN
our	PRP$

could	MD
only	RB

Richard	NNP
himself	PRP
sweeping	JJ

that	WDT
everything	NN

that	IN

My	PRP$

For	IN

I	PRP

And	CC
then	RB
I	PRP

My	PRP$

I	PRP

There	EX

I	PRP

Then	RB
I	PRP
put	VBP

was	VBD

At	IN

my	PRP$

It	PRP

Heaven	NNP

One	CD

not	RB

I	PRP
was	VBD
doubtful	JJ

I	PRP

At	IN

the	DT

Not	RB
a	DT

very	RB

resolved	VBD

I	PRP
