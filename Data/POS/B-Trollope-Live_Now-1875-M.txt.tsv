But	CC
the	DT

Among	IN

Mr.	NNP

the	DT
one	CD

and	CC
Mr.	NNP
Broune	NNP
was	VBD
fond	JJ

It	PRP
may	MD
be	VB
as	RB
well	RB
to	TO
give	VB
a	DT
short	JJ
record	NN
of	IN

which	WDT

She	PRP

to	TO

No.	NN

whereas	IN
she	PRP

A	DT

Mr.	NNP

It	PRP

No	DT

No	DT

Without	IN

``	``

``	``

By-the-bye	NN

So	RB
saying	VBG
he	PRP
put	VBD

out	IN

``	``

``	``

Then	RB
he	PRP
jumped	VBD
out	IN
of	IN
the	DT

called	VBD
a	DT

and	CC
had	VBD
himself	PRP

He	PRP

Dolly	RB

He	PRP

after	IN

he	PRP

determined	VBN

submitted	VBN

So	IN
he	PRP
argued	VBD
with	IN
himself	PRP
;	:

Neither	DT

they	PRP
reached	VBD

had	VBD

Then	RB

that	WDT

with	IN

almost	RB

He	PRP

Then	RB
the	DT

Now	RB

The	DT

Then	RB
her	PRP$

in	IN

It	PRP

certainly	RB

He	PRP

Had	VBD
it	PRP

the	DT

He	PRP

There	EX

unless	IN
it	PRP

He	PRP

that	IN

impossible	JJ
that	IN

he	PRP
felt	VBD
himself	PRP

But	CC
then	RB
he	PRP
remembered	VBD
her	PRP$

of	IN

in	IN
London	NNP
without	IN
even	RB
an	DT

be	VB
impossible	JJ
that	IN
he	PRP
should	MD
leave	VB

without	IN

So	IN
he	PRP
wrote	VBD
to	TO
her	PRP$
thus	RB
;	:
--	:

Some	DT
half-formed	JJ

ran	VBD
through	IN

that	IN
P.	NNP
M.	NNP
was	VBD
a	DT

Then	RB
came	VBD
a	DT

train	NN
of	IN

She	PRP

And	CC
now	RB

after	IN

Hitherto	NNP

He	PRP

impulsive	JJ

capricious	JJ

at	IN

violent	JJ

but	CC
never	RB

Perhaps	RB
he	PRP

His	PRP$

misgave	NN
him	PRP
that	IN

;	:
but	CC
still	RB
he	PRP

And	CC
yet	RB
did	VBD
not	RB
her	PRP$

The	DT

If	IN

Mr.	NNP

Under	IN

what	WP

the	DT

He	PRP

and	CC

that	IN
he	PRP
might	MD
almost	RB

In	IN

either	RB

It	PRP

A	DT

which	WDT
he	PRP

They	PRP

They	PRP

He	PRP

He	PRP

He	PRP

He	PRP

But	CC

such	JJ

It	PRP

He	PRP

seen	VBN
her	PRP$
twice	RB

once	RB
on	IN
the	DT
following	VBG

,	,
when	WRB
he	PRP

to	TO
come	VB

go	VB
without	IN
any	DT
special	JJ

to	TO
their	PRP$

,	,
and	CC
again	RB
,	,
three	CD

afterwards	RB

when	WRB
the	DT

was	VBD
by	IN

She	PRP

and	CC
after	IN

She	PRP
had	VBD
stood	VBN
upon	IN
what	WP
she	PRP
called	VBD

,	,
and	CC
had	VBD
dared	VBN
him	PRP
to	TO
be	VB
false	JJ
to	TO
her	PRP

Did	VBD
he	PRP
mean	VB
to	TO
deny	VB
that	IN
he	PRP
had	VBD
promised	VBN
to	TO
marry	VB
her	PRP
?	.

Was	VBD
not	RB

ever	RB

had	VBD
now	RB
been	VBN
in	IN
London	NNP

a	DT
repetition	NN
of	IN
that	DT

And	CC
then	RB
again	RB
she	PRP
became	VBD
soft	JJ
,	,
and	CC
pleaded	VBD

him	PRP
.	.

But	CC
for	IN
the	DT
storm	NN
he	PRP
might	MD
have	VB
given	VBN

At	IN
that	DT
moment	NN
he	PRP
had	VBD
felt	VBN
that	IN
any	DT
fate	NN
in	IN
life	NN
would	MD
be	VB
better	JJR
than	IN
a	DT
marriage	NN
on	IN

Her	PRP$
tears	NNS
and	CC
her	PRP$
pleadings	NNS
,	,
nevertheless	RB
,	,
touched	VBD
him	PRP
very	RB
nearly	RB

He	PRP
had	VBD
promised	VBN
her	PRP$
most	RBS
distinctly	RB
.	.

He	PRP
had	VBD
loved	VBN
her	PRP$
and	CC
had	VBD
won	VBN
her	PRP$

And	CC
she	PRP
was	VBD
lovely	JJ

The	DT
very	RB
violence	NN
of	IN
the	DT
storm	NN
made	VBD
the	DT
sunshine	NN
more	RBR

She	PRP
would	MD
sit	VB
down	RP
on	IN
a	DT

at	IN
his	PRP$

,	,
and	CC
it	PRP
was	VBD
impossible	JJ
to	TO
drive	VB
her	PRP$
away	RB
from	IN
him	PRP
.	.

She	PRP
would	MD
look	VB
up	RP
in	IN
his	PRP$
face	NN
and	CC
he	PRP
could	MD
not	RB
but	CC
embrace	VB
her	PRP

Then	RB
there	EX
had	VBD
come	VBN
a	DT
passionate	JJ
flood	NN
of	IN

and	CC
she	PRP
was	VBD

How	WRB

her	PRP$
again	RB
before	IN
two	CD

On	IN

as	IN

she	PRP

She	PRP

the	DT

Didon	NNP

that	IN

would	MD
marry	VB
them	PRP

and	CC
that	IN

She	PRP

what	WP
she	PRP

They	PRP
determined	VBD
to	TO

in	IN
the	DT

so	RB
that	IN
no	DT

Didon	NNP

She	PRP

MY	NNP
DEAR	NNP
MRS.	NNP

if	IN

it	PRP

But	CC
I	PRP

that	IN

can	MD
be	VB
of	IN
no	DT

I	PRP

It	PRP

When	WRB

They	PRP

now	RB
what	WP
I	PRP

But	CC
circumstances	NNS

that	IN

Of	IN

the	DT

mine	NN

but	CC
it	PRP
is	VBZ
better	JJR
to	TO
own	VB
that	DT

and	CC
to	TO
take	VB
all	PDT
the	DT

and	CC
the	DT

let	VB

what	WP
they	PRP

--	:
to	TO

for	IN

like	IN
the	DT

But	CC
I	PRP

The	DT
first	JJ

I	PRP
could	MD

But	CC
I	PRP
should	MD
not	RB
of	IN
my	PRP$

have	VBP
spoken	VBN
to	TO
you	PRP
of	IN

It	PRP
was	VBD
after	IN
I	PRP

that	IN
I	PRP

It	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

All	DT

the	DT

The	DT

She	PRP

He	PRP

also	RB
received	VBD
the	DT

It	PRP
seemed	VBD
that	IN
about	IN
two	CD
o'clock	RB
in	IN
the	DT
day	NN
the	DT

was	VBD
known	VBN
to	TO

Of	IN

all	PDT

in	IN
that	DT

would	MD
have	VB
been	VBN
taken	VBN
in	IN

Stupid	JJ
fool	NN
of	IN

to	TO

,	,
--	:
nay	NN

to	TO
throw	VB
away	RP
the	DT
certainty	NN
of	IN
a	DT

,	,
in	IN
that	DT

!	.

But	CC
his	PRP$
anger	NN
against	IN
Sir	NNP
Felix	NNP
was	VBD
infinitely	RB
more	RBR
bitter	JJ
than	IN
his	PRP$
anger	NN
against	IN
his	PRP$

.	.

The	DT
man	NN
had	VBD
pledged	VBN
himself	PRP
to	TO
abstain	VB
from	IN

of	IN

Marie	NNP

Melmotte	NNP
had	VBD
of	IN

learned	VBD
all	PDT

how	WRB

Didon	NNP
,	,
and	CC
how	WRB
Didon	NNP
had	VBD
given	VBN

Sir	NNP
Felix	NNP

Marie	NNP
herself	PRP
acknowledged	VBD
that	IN
Sir	NNP

If	IN

he	PRP
would	MD
prosecute	VB

Had	VBD
Melmotte	NNP
been	VBN
altogether	RB
a	DT
prudent	JJ

he	PRP
would	MD
probably	RB
have	VB
been	VBN
satisfied	VBN
with	IN
getting	VBG
back	RB

and	CC
would	MD
have	VB
allowed	VBN
the	DT

At	IN
this	DT
especial	JJ
point	NN
in	IN
his	PRP$
career	NN
ready	JJ
money	NN
was	VBD
very	RB
valuable	JJ
to	TO

but	CC
his	PRP$

of	IN
such	JJ
magnitude	NN
that	WDT
250	CD
could	MD
make	VB

But	CC
there	EX
had	VBD
grown	VBN
upon	IN
the	DT
man	NN
during	IN
the	DT
last	JJ
few	JJ
months	NNS
an	DT
arrogance	NN

a	DT
self-confidence	NN
inspired	VBN
in	IN
him	PRP
by	IN
the	DT
worship	NN
of	IN
other	JJ
men	NNS
,	,
which	WDT
clouded	VBD
his	PRP$

robbed	VBD

which	WDT
undoubtedly	RB
he	PRP
naturally	RB

He	PRP
remembered	VBD
perfectly	RB
his	PRP$
various	JJ
little	JJ

with	IN
Sir	NNP

Indeed	RB
it	PRP
was	VBD

He	PRP

stood	VBD

even	RB

Sir	NNP

In	IN

a	DT

Now	RB

made	VBD

The	DT

that	IN

But	CC
,	,
day	NN

every	DT

Latterly	RB

in	IN

there	EX

the	DT

himself	PRP

but	CC
in	IN

to	TO

it	PRP

stated	VBN

induced	VBN

to	TO
consent	NN
to	TO
accept	VB

The	DT

died	VBN
during	IN

and	CC
it	PRP
was	VBD
asserted	VBN
that	IN
the	DT
old	JJ

was	VBD
hardly	RB

Melmotte	NNP
had	VBD
certainly	RB
raised	VBN
between	IN
twenty	CD

thirty	CD
thousand	CD

on	IN

in	IN

which	WDT
was	VBD
now	RB
worth	JJ
--	:
almost	RB
nothing	NN
at	IN
all	DT

Melmotte	NNP
thought	VBD
that	IN
he	PRP
might	MD
face	VB
this	DT

successfully	RB
if	IN
the	DT

came	VBD
upon	IN
him	PRP
single-handed	JJ
;	:
--	:
but	CC
in	IN
regard	NN
to	TO
the	DT
Longestaffes	NNPS
he	PRP
considered	VBD
that	IN
now	RB
,	,
at	IN
this	DT
last	JJ
moment	NN
,	,
he	PRP
had	VBD
better	RBR
pay	VB
for	IN
Pickering	NNP

The	DT
property	NN
from	IN
which	WDT
he	PRP
intended	VBD
to	TO
raise	VB
the	DT
necessary	JJ
funds	NNS
was	VBD
really	RB
his	PRP$
own	JJ
.	.

There	EX
could	MD
be	VB
no	DT
doubt	NN
about	IN
that	DT

It	PRP
had	VBD
never	RB
been	VBN
his	PRP$
intention	NN
to	TO
make	VB
it	PRP

to	TO
his	PRP$

When	WRB
he	PRP
had	VBD
placed	VBN
it	PRP
in	IN
her	PRP$

,	,
he	PRP
had	VBD
done	VBN
so	RB
simply	RB
for	IN

,	,
--	:
feeling	NN
that	IN
his	PRP$

over	IN
his	PRP$
only	JJ
daughter	NN
would	MD
be	VB
perfect	JJ
and	CC
free	JJ
from	IN

No	DT
girl	NN
apparently	RB
less	RBR
likely	JJ
to	TO
take	VB
it	PRP
into	IN
her	PRP$

to	TO
defraud	VB
her	PRP$

could	MD
have	VB

Nor	CC
did	VBD
he	PRP
now	RB
think	VBP
that	IN
she	PRP
would	MD
disobey	VB
him	PRP
when	WRB
the	DT
matter	NN
was	VBD
explained	VBN
to	TO
her	PRP

Heavens	NNS
and	CC
earth	NN
!	.

That	IN
he	PRP
should	MD
be	VB
robbed	VBN
by	IN
his	PRP$

child	NN
,	,
--	:
robbed	VBN
openly	RB
,	,
shamefully	RB
,	,
with	IN
brazen	VB
audacity	NN
!	.

It	PRP
was	VBD
impossible	JJ
.	.

But	CC
still	RB
he	PRP
had	VBD
felt	VBN
the	DT
necessity	NN
of	IN
going	VBG
about	RB
this	DT
business	NN
with	IN
some	DT
little	JJ
care	NN
.	.

It	PRP
might	MD
be	VB
that	IN
she	PRP
would	MD
disobey	VB
him	PRP
if	IN
he	PRP
simply	RB
sent	VBD

her	PRP
and	CC
bade	VB
her	PRP
to	TO
affix	VB
her	PRP$
signature	NN
here	RB
and	CC
there	RB
.	.

He	PRP
thought	VBD
much	RB
about	IN
it	PRP
and	CC
considered	VBN
that	IN
it	PRP
would	MD
be	VB
wise	JJ
that	IN
his	PRP$

on	IN

and	CC
that	IN

by	IN

that	IN

So	IN
he	PRP
gave	VBD

when	WRB
he	PRP
started	VBD
into	IN

to	TO

he	PRP
brought	VBD

it	PRP

that	IN

When	WRB

Her	PRP$

that	IN

Mr.	NNP

She	PRP

she	PRP

that	IN

at	IN

she	PRP

that	IN

London	NNP
with	IN
a	DT

that	IN

She	PRP

taken	VBN
his	PRP$

It	PRP

MY	NNP

As	IN

I	PRP
have	VBP

a	DT

it	PRP
would	MD

And	CC
if	IN
I	PRP

I	PRP
'm	VBP
sure	JJ
somebody	NN
ought	MD
to	TO
be	VB
very	RB

But	CC
papa	NN
has	VBZ
been	VBN
very	RB
unfair	JJ
in	IN
what	WP
he	PRP

As	IN
to	TO

it	PRP
could	MD

for	IN

he	PRP

He	PRP

a	DT

I	PRP

I	PRP

But	CC
the	DT
world	NN
does	VBZ
change	VB
so	RB

that	IN

does	VBZ
n't	RB
think	VB

I	PRP

The	DT

Much	JJ
of	IN

Unless	IN

He	PRP

How	WRB

now	RB

Though	NNP

that	IN

She	PRP

Two	CD

the	DT

She	PRP
