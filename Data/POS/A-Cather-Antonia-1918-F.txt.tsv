Clearly	RB

I	PRP

and	CC
when	WRB
I	PRP

a	DT

After	IN

it	PRP

The	DT
third	JJ

I	PRP
spent	VBD

I	PRP
awoke	VBD
suddenly	RB
with	IN
the	DT
impression	NN
that	IN
I	PRP
had	VBD
heard	VBN
a	DT
door	NN
open	JJ

Everything	NN
was	VBD

however	RB

and	CC
I	PRP
must	MD
have	VB
gone	VBN

The	DT
next	JJ
thing	NN
I	PRP
knew	VBD

I	PRP
felt	VBD
someone	NN
sit	VBP
down	RP
on	IN

I	PRP
was	VBD
only	RB

Perhaps	RB
if	IN

he	PRP
would	MD
find	VB
it	PRP

get	VB
out	RP

I	PRP
held	VBD
my	PRP$
breath	NN
and	CC
lay	VBD
absolutely	RB
still	RB

A	DT
hand	NN
closed	VBD
softly	RB
on	IN
my	PRP$

and	CC
at	IN
the	DT
same	JJ
moment	NN
I	PRP
felt	VBD
something	NN
hairy	JJ

cologne-scented	JJ
brushing	NN
my	PRP$

If	IN
the	DT

had	VBD
suddenly	RB
been	VBN
flooded	VBN

I	PRP
could	MD

the	DT
detestable	JJ

that	IN
I	PRP

I	PRP
caught	VBD
a	DT
handful	NN
of	IN
whiskers	NNS
and	CC
pulled	VBD

shouting	VBG
something	NN

The	DT
hand	NN
that	WDT
held	VBD
my	PRP$
shoulder	NN
was	VBD
instantly	RB
at	IN
my	PRP$
throat	NN

The	DT
man	NN
became	VBD
insane	JJ
;	:
he	PRP
stood	VBD
over	IN
me	PRP

choking	VBG
me	PRP
with	IN
one	CD

beating	VBG
me	PRP

`	``

this	DT

So	RB
long	RB
as	IN
Cutter	NNP
had	VBD
me	PRP
by	IN
the	DT
throat	NN

there	EX
was	VBD
no	DT

I	PRP
got	VBD
hold	NN

his	PRP$

bent	JJ
it	PRP
back	RB

until	IN
he	PRP
let	VBD

In	IN

I	PRP

and	CC
easily	RB
sent	VBD
him	PRP

Then	RB
I	PRP
made	VBD
a	DT
dive	NN
for	IN
the	DT
open	JJ
window	NN

struck	VBD
the	DT
wire	NN

knocked	VBD
it	PRP
out	RP

and	CC
tumbled	VBD
after	IN
it	PRP
into	IN

Suddenly	RB
I	PRP
found	VBD
myself	PRP
running	VBG
across	IN

When	WRB
I	PRP
got	VBD
home	NN

I	PRP
climbed	VBD
in	IN
at	IN
the	DT

I	PRP
was	VBD
covered	VBN

but	CC
I	PRP
was	VBD
too	RB

I	PRP
found	VBD
a	DT

lay	VBD
down	RP
on	IN

and	CC
in	IN
spite	NN
of	IN
my	PRP$

went	VBD
to	TO

Grandmother	NN
found	VBD
me	PRP
there	EX
in	IN
the	DT
morning	NN

Her	PRP$
cry	NN

fright	NN
awakened	VBD
me	PRP

Truly	RB

I	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT

As	IN
she	PRP

I	PRP
caught	VBD
a	DT
glimpse	NN

My	PRP$

was	VBD
cut	VBN

stood	VBD
out	RP

My	PRP$

and	CC
one	CD

was	VBD
swollen	JJ
shut	VBN

hideously	RB
discoloured	VBN

Grandmother	NN
said	VBD
we	PRP
must	MD
have	VB
the	DT
doctor	NN
at	IN
once	RB

but	CC
I	PRP
implored	VBD
her	PRP

as	IN
I	PRP

never	RB

not	RB

I	PRP
could	MD

I	PRP

so	RB
long	RB
as	IN
nobody	NN
saw	VBD

knew	VBD
what	WP

I	PRP

not	RB

She	PRP

though	IN
I	PRP
was	VBD
too	RB

miserable	JJ
to	TO

When	WRB
she	PRP
took	VBD
off	RP
my	PRP$

she	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP
asked	VBD

I	PRP
felt	VBD
that	IN

I	PRP
hated	VBD

She	PRP
