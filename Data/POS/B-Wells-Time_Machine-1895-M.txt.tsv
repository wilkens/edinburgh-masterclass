all	DT

My	PRP$

this	DT

He	PRP

The	DT

For	IN

Why	WRB

I	PRP

It	PRP

Probably	RB

In	IN

It	PRP

It	PRP

It	PRP

the	DT

I	PRP

With	IN

I	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

The	DT

`	``
She	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

Here	RB

`	``
The	DT

I	PRP
lit	VBD
a	DT

as	IN
I	PRP
did	VBD
so	RB

two	CD
white	JJ

Weena	NNP

One	CD

blinded	VBN

that	IN
he	PRP

straight	RB

I	PRP
felt	VBD
his	PRP$

He	PRP
gave	VBD

staggered	VBD

I	PRP
lit	VBD
another	DT

went	VBD

Presently	RB
I	PRP

So	RB

instead	RB

I	PRP

Very	RB

a	DT

Then	RB
I	PRP
turned	VBD

I	PRP

`	``
Now	RB

the	DT

it	PRP

Moreover	RB

the	DT

My	PRP$

I	PRP

The	DT

Flinging	VBG

I	PRP

`	``
It	PRP

`	``
So	RB

the	DT

that	DT

Apparently	RB

the	DT

however	RB

I	PRP

The	DT

A	DT

that	IN

The	DT

`	``
Suddenly	RB

For	IN

Either	CC

`	``
The	DT

the	DT

From	IN

Beyond	IN
