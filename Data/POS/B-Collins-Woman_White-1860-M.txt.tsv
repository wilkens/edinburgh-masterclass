It	PRP

During	IN

The	DT

I	PRP

the	DT
London	NNP

the	DT

the	DT

I	PRP
roused	VBD

I	PRP
was	VBD
dreaming	VBG
over	IN
rather	RB

It	PRP

one	CD

My	PRP$

Miss	NNP

the	DT

--	:
not	RB
so	RB

I	PRP

We	PRP

a	DT

a	DT

so	RB

I	PRP

Mr.	NNP

on	IN
our	PRP$
first	JJ

to	TO

but	CC
I	PRP
soon	RB

not	RB
free	JJ
from	IN
the	DT
social	JJ
failings	NNS

There	EX

they	PRP

Mr.	NNP
Hartright	NNP
was	VBD
no	DT

Otherwise	RB
,	,
even	RB
in	IN
those	DT

Miss	NNP

At	IN

All	DT

The	DT

The	DT

The	DT
