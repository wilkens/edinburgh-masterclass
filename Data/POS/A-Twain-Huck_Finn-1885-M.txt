Now	RB
the	DT

this	DT
:	:
Tom	NNP

We	PRP

It	PRP
was	VBD
an	DT
awful	JJ
sight	NN
of	IN
money	NN
when	WRB
it	PRP

piled	VBN
up	RP

Well	RB

Judge	NNP
Thatcher	NNP
he	PRP
took	VBD
it	PRP

put	VB
it	PRP
out	RP

it	PRP
fetched	VBD

a	DT

a	DT

all	PDT
the	DT

--	:
more	JJR
than	IN
a	DT

The	DT
Widow	NNP
Douglas	NNP
she	PRP
took	VBD
me	PRP
for	IN
her	PRP$
son	NN
,	,
and	CC
allowed	VBD
she	PRP
would	MD
sivilize	VB
me	PRP

but	CC
it	PRP
was	VBD
rough	JJ
living	NN
in	IN
the	DT
house	NN
all	PDT
the	DT
time	NN
,	,
considering	VBG
how	WRB
dismal	JJ
regular	JJ
and	CC
decent	JJ
the	DT
widow	NN
was	VBD
in	IN
all	DT
her	PRP$
ways	NNS
;	:
and	CC
so	RB
when	WRB
I	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB
stand	VB
it	PRP
no	RB

I	PRP
lit	VBD
out	RP

I	PRP
got	VBD
into	IN
my	PRP$
old	JJ
rags	NNS
and	CC
my	PRP$
sugar-hogshead	NN
again	RB
,	,
and	CC
was	VBD
free	JJ
and	CC
satisfied	JJ

But	CC
Tom	NNP
Sawyer	NNP
he	PRP
hunted	VBD
me	PRP
up	RP
and	CC
said	VBD
he	PRP
was	VBD
going	VBG
to	TO
start	VB
a	DT
band	NN
of	IN

and	CC
I	PRP

join	VB
if	IN
I	PRP
would	MD
go	VB
back	RB
to	TO
the	DT
widow	NN
and	CC
be	VB
respectable	JJ

So	IN
I	PRP
went	VBD
back	RB

The	DT
widow	NN
she	PRP
cried	VBD
over	IN
me	PRP
,	,
and	CC
called	VBD
me	PRP
a	DT
poor	JJ
lost	VBN
lamb	NN

and	CC
she	PRP
called	VBD
me	PRP
a	DT

of	IN
other	JJ

,	,
too	RB
,	,
but	CC
she	PRP
never	RB
meant	VBD
no	DT

by	IN
it	PRP

She	PRP
put	VBD
me	PRP
in	IN
them	PRP

and	CC
I	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB

nothing	NN
but	CC
sweat	NN
and	CC
sweat	NN
,	,
and	CC
feel	VB
all	DT
cramped	VBN
up	RP

Well	RB
,	,
then	RB
,	,
the	DT
old	JJ
thing	NN
commenced	VBD
again	RB

The	DT
widow	NN
rung	VBD
a	DT
bell	NN
for	IN
supper	NN
,	,
and	CC
you	PRP
had	VBD

come	VB

When	WRB
you	PRP
got	VBD
to	TO
the	DT
table	NN
you	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB
go	VB
right	RB
to	TO

,	,
but	CC
you	PRP
had	VBD
to	TO
wait	VB
for	IN
the	DT
widow	NN
to	TO
tuck	VB
down	RP
her	PRP$
head	NN
and	CC
grumble	VB
a	DT
little	JJ
over	IN
the	DT
victuals	NNS
,	,
though	IN
there	EX
war	NN
n't	RB
really	RB
anything	NN
the	DT

with	IN
them	PRP

--	:
that	WDT
is	VBZ
,	,
nothing	NN
only	RB
everything	NN
was	VBD
cooked	VBN
by	IN

In	IN
a	DT
barrel	NN
of	IN
odds	NNS
and	CC
ends	VBZ
it	PRP
is	VBZ
different	JJ
;	:
things	NNS
get	VBP
mixed	VBN
up	RP
,	,
and	CC
the	DT
juice	NN
kind	NN
of	IN
swaps	NNS
around	RB
,	,
and	CC
the	DT
things	NNS
go	VB
better	RBR

After	IN
supper	NN
she	PRP
got	VBD
out	RP
her	PRP$
book	NN
and	CC
learned	VBD
me	PRP
about	IN
Moses	NNP
and	CC
the	DT
Bulrushers	NNPS
,	,
and	CC
I	PRP
was	VBD
in	IN
a	DT
sweat	NN
to	TO
find	VB
out	RP
all	DT
about	IN
him	PRP
;	:
but	CC
by	IN
and	CC
by	IN
she	PRP
let	VBD
it	PRP
out	RP
that	IN
Moses	NNP
had	VBD
been	VBN
dead	JJ
a	DT
considerable	JJ
long	JJ
time	NN
;	:
so	RB
then	RB
I	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB
care	VB
no	DT
more	JJR
about	IN
him	PRP
,	,
because	IN
I	PRP
do	VBP
n't	RB
take	VB
no	DT
stock	NN
in	IN
dead	JJ
people	NNS

Pretty	NNP
soon	RB
I	PRP
wanted	VBD
to	TO
smoke	VB
,	,
and	CC
asked	VBD
the	DT
widow	NN
to	TO
let	VB

But	CC
she	PRP
would	MD
n't	RB

She	PRP
said	VBD
it	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
mean	NN
practice	NN
and	CC
was	VBD
n't	RB
clean	JJ
,	,
and	CC
I	PRP
must	MD
try	VB
to	TO
not	RB
do	VB
it	PRP
any	DT
more	RBR

That	DT
is	VBZ
just	RB
the	DT
way	NN
with	IN
some	DT
people	NNS

They	PRP
get	VBP
down	RP
on	IN
a	DT
thing	NN
when	WRB
they	PRP
do	VBP
n't	RB
know	VB
nothing	NN
about	IN
it	PRP

Here	RB
she	PRP
was	VBD
a-bothering	VBG
about	IN
Moses	NNP
,	,
which	WDT
was	VBD
no	DT
kin	NN
to	TO

and	CC
no	DT

to	TO
anybody	NN

being	VBG
gone	VBN

you	PRP

yet	CC
finding	VBG
a	DT

me	PRP
for	IN
doing	VBG
a	DT
thing	NN
that	WDT
had	VBD
some	DT
good	JJ
in	IN
it	PRP

And	CC
she	PRP
took	VBD
snuff	NN
,	,
too	RB
;	:
of	IN
course	NN
that	WDT
was	VBD
all	DT
right	RB
,	,
because	IN
she	PRP

Her	PRP$
sister	NN

Miss	NNP
Watson	NNP
,	,
a	DT
tolerable	JJ
slim	JJ
old	JJ
maid	NN
,	,
with	IN

had	VBD
just	RB
come	VBN

her	PRP
,	,
and	CC
took	VBD
a	DT
set	VBN
at	IN
me	PRP
now	RB
with	IN
a	DT

She	PRP
worked	VBD
me	PRP
middling	JJ
hard	JJ
for	IN
about	IN
an	DT
hour	NN
,	,
and	CC
then	RB
the	DT
widow	NN
made	VBD
her	PRP$
ease	NN
up	RP

I	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB
stood	VBD
it	PRP
much	RB

Then	RB
for	IN
an	DT
hour	NN
it	PRP
was	VBD
deadly	JJ
dull	JJ
,	,
and	CC
I	PRP
was	VBD
fidgety	JJ

Miss	NNP
Watson	NNP
would	MD
say	VB

``	``
Do	VBP
n't	RB

Huckleberry	NNP

``	``

Huckleberry	NNP

''	''
and	CC
pretty	RB
soon	RB
she	PRP

Huckleberry	NNP

why	WRB
do	VBP
n't	RB
you	PRP

''	''

Then	RB
she	PRP
told	VBD
me	PRP
all	DT
about	IN
the	DT
bad	JJ
place	NN
,	,
and	CC
I	PRP
said	VBD
I	PRP
wished	VBD
I	PRP
was	VBD
there	RB
.	.

She	PRP
got	VBD
mad	JJ
then	RB
,	,
but	CC
I	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB
mean	VB
no	DT
harm	NN

All	DT
I	PRP
wanted	VBD
was	VBD
to	TO
go	VB
somewheres	NNS
;	:
all	DT
I	PRP
wanted	VBD
was	VBD
a	DT
change	NN
,	,
I	PRP
war	NN
n't	RB
particular	JJ

She	PRP
said	VBD
it	PRP
was	VBD
wicked	JJ
to	TO
say	VB
what	WP
I	PRP
said	VBD
;	:
said	VBD
she	PRP
would	MD
n't	RB
say	VB
it	PRP
for	IN
the	DT
whole	JJ
world	NN
;	:
she	PRP
was	VBD
going	VBG
to	TO
live	VB
so	RB
as	IN
to	TO
go	VB
to	TO
the	DT
good	JJ
place	NN
.	.

Well	RB
,	,
I	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB
see	VB
no	DT
advantage	NN
in	IN
going	VBG
where	WRB
she	PRP
was	VBD
going	VBG
,	,
so	IN
I	PRP
made	VBD
up	RP
my	PRP$
mind	NN
I	PRP
would	MD
n't	RB
try	VB
for	IN
it	PRP
.	.

But	CC
I	PRP
never	RB
said	VBD
so	RB
,	,
because	IN
it	PRP
would	MD
only	RB
make	VB
trouble	NN
,	,
and	CC
would	MD
n't	RB
do	VB
no	DT
good	JJ
.	.

Now	RB
she	PRP
had	VBD
got	VBN
a	DT
start	NN
,	,
and	CC
she	PRP
went	VBD
on	IN
and	CC
told	VBD
me	PRP
all	DT
about	IN
the	DT
good	JJ
place	NN

She	PRP
said	VBD
all	PDT
a	DT

would	MD
have	VB
to	TO
do	VB
there	EX
was	VBD
to	TO
go	VB

all	DT
day	NN
long	RB
with	IN
a	DT
harp	NN
and	CC
sing	VB
,	,
forever	RB
and	CC
ever	RB

So	IN
I	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB
think	VB
much	JJ
of	IN
it	PRP

But	CC
I	PRP
never	RB
said	VBD
so	RB
.	.

I	PRP
asked	VBD
her	PRP$
if	IN
she	PRP
reckoned	VBD
Tom	NNP
Sawyer	NNP
would	MD
go	VB
there	RB
,	,
and	CC
she	PRP
said	VBD
not	RB
by	IN
a	DT
considerable	JJ

I	PRP
was	VBD
glad	JJ
about	IN
that	DT
,	,
because	IN
I	PRP
wanted	VBD
him	PRP
and	CC
me	PRP
to	TO
be	VB

Miss	NNP
Watson	NNP
she	PRP
kept	VBD
pecking	VBG
at	IN
me	PRP
,	,
and	CC
it	PRP
got	VBD
tiresome	JJ
and	CC
lonesome	JJ

By	IN
and	CC
by	IN
they	PRP
fetched	VBD
the	DT

and	CC
had	VBD
prayers	NNS
,	,
and	CC
then	RB
everybody	NN
was	VBD
off	RB

I	PRP
went	VBD
up	RB
to	TO
my	PRP$
room	NN
with	IN
a	DT
piece	NN
of	IN
candle	NN
,	,
and	CC
put	VBD
it	PRP
on	IN
the	DT

Then	RB
I	PRP
set	VBP
down	RP
in	IN
a	DT
chair	NN
by	IN
the	DT
window	NN
and	CC
tried	VBD
to	TO
think	VB
of	IN
something	NN
cheerful	JJ
,	,
but	CC
it	PRP
war	NN
n't	RB
no	DT

.	.

I	PRP
felt	VBD
so	RB
lonesome	JJ
I	PRP
most	RBS
wished	VBN
I	PRP
was	VBD
dead	JJ
.	.

The	DT
stars	NNS
were	VBD
shining	VBG
,	,
and	CC
the	DT
leaves	NNS
rustled	VBD
in	IN
the	DT
woods	NNS
ever	RB
so	RB
mournful	JJ
;	:
and	CC
I	PRP
heard	VBD
an	DT

away	RB
off	RB

who-whooing	JJ
about	IN
somebody	NN
that	WDT
was	VBD
dead	JJ
,	,
and	CC
a	DT
whippowill	NN
and	CC
a	DT
dog	NN
crying	VBG
about	IN
somebody	NN
that	WDT
was	VBD
going	VBG
to	TO

;	:
and	CC
the	DT
wind	NN
was	VBD
trying	VBG
to	TO
whisper	VB
something	NN
to	TO
me	PRP
,	,
and	CC
I	PRP
could	MD
n't	RB
make	VB
out	RP
what	WP
it	PRP

and	CC
so	IN
it	PRP
made	VBD
the	DT
cold	JJ
shivers	NNS
run	VBP
over	IN
me	PRP

Then	RB
away	RB
out	IN
in	IN
the	DT

I	PRP
heard	VBD
that	DT

of	IN
a	DT

it	PRP
wants	VBZ

I	PRP
got	VBD
so	RB
down-hearted	JJ

I	PRP
did	VBD

I	PRP

Pretty	NNP

I	PRP

it	PRP

and	CC
before	IN
I	PRP

I	PRP
did	VBD

Then	RB
Miss	NNP

she	PRP

in	IN

but	CC
nothing	NN

She	PRP

But	CC
it	PRP

Once	RB

It	PRP

I	PRP

somehow	RB

one	CD

I	PRP
set	VBP

I	PRP

This	DT

This	DT

I	PRP

I	PRP

Sometimes	RB

I	PRP

I	PRP

he	PRP

I	PRP

He	PRP

when	WRB
he	PRP

about	IN

They	PRP

this	DT

but	CC
they	PRP

it	PRP
war	NN
n't	RB

They	PRP

They	PRP

him	PRP

But	CC
I	PRP
war	NN

Well	RB

I	PRP

``	``

I	PRP

You	PRP

they	PRP

trying	VBG

I	PRP

So	IN
I	PRP
set	VBP

watched	VBD
the	DT

The	DT

it	PRP

Well	RB

they	PRP

So	RB

says	VBZ
I	PRP

I	PRP
'll	MD

I	PRP

my	PRP$

Of	IN

I	PRP

But	CC

I	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

And	CC
then	RB
something	NN

I	PRP

it	PRP

I	PRP

When	WRB

Then	RB

I	PRP

I	PRP

I	PRP

long	JJ

that	WDT

long	JJ

She	PRP

four	CD

so	IN
we	PRP
judged	VBD
she	PRP
carried	VBD

as	IN
thirty	CD

likely	RB

She	PRP
had	VBD
five	CD
big	JJ

and	CC
an	DT

in	IN
the	DT
middle	NN

and	CC
a	DT

each	DT

There	EX
was	VBD
a	DT
power	NN

about	IN

It	PRP
_	VBD
amounted	VBD

to	TO
something	NN
being	VBG

We	PRP

drifting	VBG

and	CC
the	DT
night	NN
clouded	VBD

The	DT
river	NN
was	VBD
very	RB
wide	JJ

you	PRP

hardly	RB

or	CC
a	DT

We	PRP
talked	VBD
about	IN
Cairo	NNP

wondered	VBD
whether	IN
we	PRP
would	MD
know	VB
it	PRP
when	WRB
we	PRP
got	VBD
to	TO
it	PRP

I	PRP
said	VBD
likely	RB
we	PRP
would	MD
n't	RB
,	,
because	IN
I	PRP
had	VBD
heard	VBN
say	VBP
there	EX
war	NN
n't	RB
but	CC
about	RB
a	DT
dozen	NN
houses	NNS

and	CC
if	IN
they	PRP

n't	RB
happen	VB
to	TO
have	VB
them	PRP
lit	VBN
up	RP
,	,
how	WRB
was	VBD
we	PRP
going	VBG
to	TO
know	VB
we	PRP
was	VBD
passing	VBG
a	DT

?	.

Jim	NNP
said	VBD
if	IN
the	DT
two	CD
big	JJ
rivers	NNS
joined	VBN
together	RB
there	RB
,	,
that	WDT
would	MD
show	VB

But	CC
I	PRP
said	VBD
maybe	RB
we	PRP
might	MD

we	PRP
was	VBD
passing	VBG
the	DT

an	DT

coming	VBG

old	JJ

That	DT
disturbed	JJ
Jim	NNP

me	PRP

So	IN
the	DT
question	NN
was	VBD
,	,
what	WP
to	TO
do	VB
?	.

I	PRP
said	VBD
,	,
paddle	NN
ashore	RB
the	DT
first	JJ

a	DT

wanted	VBD

know	VB
how	WRB

it	PRP

to	TO
Cairo	NNP

Jim	NNP
thought	VBD
it	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
good	JJ
idea	NN
,	,
so	IN
we	PRP
took	VBD
a	DT
smoke	NN
on	IN
it	PRP

waited	VBD

There	EX
war	NN
n't	RB
nothing	NN

do	VB
now	RB
but	CC
to	TO
look	VB
out	RP
sharp	JJ
for	IN
the	DT
town	NN
,	,
and	CC
not	RB
pass	VB
it	PRP
without	IN
seeing	VBG
it	PRP

He	PRP
said	VBD
he	PRP
'd	MD
be	VB

WE	NN

for	IN

We	PRP

now	RB
,	,

a	DT
mighty	RB

We	PRP
begun	VBD

,	,
hanging	VBG
down	RP
from	IN

like	IN

,	,
gray	JJ

It	PRP
was	VBD
the	DT
first	JJ
I	PRP
ever	RB
see	VBP
it	PRP
growing	VBG
,	,
and	CC
it	PRP
made	VBD
the	DT

So	RB
now	RB
the	DT

they	PRP

they	PRP

again	RB

First	RB
they	PRP
done	VBD
a	DT

but	CC
they	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB
make	VB
enough	RB
for	IN
them	PRP
both	DT
to	TO
get	VB

Then	RB
in	IN
another	DT
village	NN
they	PRP
started	VBD
a	DT

but	CC
they	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB
know	VB
no	DT
more	JJR
how	WRB
to	TO
dance	VB
than	IN
a	DT

so	IN
the	DT
first	JJ

they	PRP
made	VBD
the	DT
general	JJ

jumped	VBD
in	IN

pranced	VBD

Another	DT

they	PRP

they	PRP

They	PRP

but	CC
they	PRP
could	MD

So	RB
at	IN
last	JJ
they	PRP
got	VBD
just	RB
about	IN

broke	VBD

laid	VBN

And	CC
at	IN
last	JJ
they	PRP
took	VBD
a	DT

Jim	NNP

We	PRP
did	VBD
n't	RB

We	PRP
judged	VBD
they	PRP
was	VBD
studying	VBG
up	RP

We	PRP
turned	VBD

at	IN

we	PRP

So	RB
then	RB
we	PRP
was	VBD
pretty	RB

made	VBD
up	RP
an	DT

that	IN

Well	RB

I	PRP

Then	RB
I	PRP

Tom	NNP

So	RB
Tom	NNP

Then	RB

``	``

He	PRP

and	CC
then	RB
he	PRP

By	IN

by	IN
he	PRP

he	PRP

there	RB
war	NN

Said	NNP
we	PRP

That	DT

we	PRP

we	PRP

it	PRP

Then	RB
we	PRP

in	IN
about	IN

We	PRP

then	RB
we	PRP

He	PRP

Tom	NNP
