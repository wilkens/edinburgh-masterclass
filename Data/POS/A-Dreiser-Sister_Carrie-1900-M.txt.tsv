CHAPTER	NN

FOUR-FIFTY	NN
A	DT
WEEK	NN
Once	RB
across	IN
the	DT
river	NN
and	CC
into	IN
the	DT
wholesale	JJ
district	NN

she	PRP
glanced	VBD
about	IN
her	PRP$
for	IN
some	DT
likely	JJ
door	NN
at	IN
which	WDT
to	TO
apply	VB

As	IN
she	PRP
contemplated	VBD
the	DT
wide	JJ
windows	NNS
and	CC
imposing	VBG
signs	NNS
,	,
she	PRP
became	VBD
conscious	JJ
of	IN
being	VBG
gazed	VBN
upon	IN
and	CC
understood	VBN
for	IN
what	WP
she	PRP
was	VBD
--	:
a	DT
wage-seeker	NN

She	PRP
had	VBD
never	RB
done	VBN
this	DT
thing	NN
before	RB

and	CC
lacked	VBD
courage	NN

To	TO
avoid	VB
a	DT
certain	JJ
indefinable	JJ

she	PRP
felt	VBD
at	IN
being	VBG
caught	VBN
spying	VBG
about	IN
for	IN
a	DT
position	NN

she	PRP
quickened	VBD
her	PRP$

assumed	VBD
an	DT
air	NN
of	IN
indifference	NN
supposedly	RB
common	JJ
to	TO
one	CD
upon	IN
an	DT
errand	NN
.	.

In	IN
this	DT
way	NN
she	PRP
passed	VBD
many	JJ
manufacturing	NN
and	CC
wholesale	JJ
houses	NNS
without	IN
once	RB
glancing	VBG
in	IN

At	IN
last	JJ
,	,
after	IN
several	JJ
blocks	NNS
of	IN
walking	VBG

she	PRP
felt	VBD
that	IN
this	DT

and	CC
began	VBD
to	TO
look	VB
about	RB
again	RB
,	,
though	RB
without	IN
relaxing	VBG
her	PRP$
pace	NN
.	.

A	DT
little	JJ
way	NN
on	IN
she	PRP
saw	VBD
a	DT
great	JJ
door	NN
which	WDT
,	,
for	IN
some	DT
reason	NN
,	,
attracted	VBD
her	PRP$
attention	NN
.	.

It	PRP
was	VBD
ornamented	VBN
by	IN
a	DT
small	JJ
brass	NN
sign	NN
,	,
and	CC
seemed	VBD
to	TO
be	VB
the	DT
entrance	NN
to	TO
a	DT
vast	JJ
hive	NN
of	IN
six	CD
or	CC
seven	CD
floors	NNS

``	``
Perhaps	RB

''	''
she	PRP
thought	VBD

``	``
they	PRP
may	MD
want	VB
some	DT
one	CD

''	''
and	CC
crossed	VBD
over	IN
to	TO
enter	VB

When	WRB
she	PRP
came	VBD
within	IN
a	DT
score	NN
of	IN
feet	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
desired	VBN

she	PRP
saw	VBD
through	IN
the	DT
window	NN
a	DT
young	JJ
man	NN
in	IN
a	DT
grey	JJ
checked	VBN
suit	NN

That	IN
he	PRP

anything	NN
to	TO
do	VB
with	IN
the	DT

she	PRP
could	MD
not	RB

because	IN
he	PRP

to	TO
be	VB
looking	VBG
in	IN
her	PRP$

her	PRP$
weakening	NN
heart	NN
misgave	NN
her	PRP$
and	CC
she	PRP
hurried	VBD
by	IN
,	,
too	RB
overcome	VBN
with	IN
shame	NN
to	TO
enter	VB

Over	IN
the	DT
way	NN
stood	VBD
a	DT
great	JJ
six-story	JJ

,	,
labelled	VBN
Storm	NN
and	CC
King	NNP
,	,
which	WDT
she	PRP
viewed	VBD
with	IN
rising	VBG

It	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT

and	CC
employed	VBN

She	PRP
could	MD
see	VB
them	PRP
moving	VBG
about	RB
now	RB
and	CC
then	RB
upon	IN
the	DT
upper	JJ

This	DT
place	NN
she	PRP
decided	VBD
to	TO
enter	VB

no	DT

what	WDT
.	.

She	PRP
crossed	VBD
over	IN
and	CC
walked	VBD
directly	RB
toward	IN
the	DT
entrance	NN

As	IN
she	PRP
did	VBD
so	RB
,	,
two	CD
men	NNS
came	VBD
out	RP
and	CC
paused	VBD
in	IN
the	DT

A	DT
telegraph	NN
messenger	NN
in	IN
blue	JJ
dashed	VBN
past	IN
her	PRP

up	IN
the	DT
few	JJ
steps	NNS
that	WDT
led	VBD
to	TO
the	DT

and	CC
disappeared	VBD

Several	JJ
pedestrians	NNS
out	IN
of	IN
the	DT
hurrying	VBG
throng	NN
which	WDT
filled	VBD
the	DT
sidewalks	NNS
passed	VBD
about	RB
her	PRP$
as	IN
she	PRP
paused	VBD

She	PRP
looked	VBD
helplessly	RB
around	RB

and	CC
then	RB
,	,
seeing	VBG

observed	VBD

It	PRP
was	VBD
too	RB
difficult	JJ
a	DT
task	NN

She	PRP
could	MD
not	RB
go	VB
past	JJ
them	PRP

So	RB
severe	JJ
a	DT
defeat	NN
told	VBD
sadly	RB
upon	IN
her	PRP$
nerves	NNS

Her	PRP$
feet	NNS
carried	VBD
her	PRP$
mechanically	RB
forward	RB

every	DT

which	WDT
she	PRP
gladly	RB
made	VBD

Block	NNP

Upon	IN

at	IN
the	DT
various	JJ

she	PRP
read	VBD

such	JJ
as	IN

She	PRP
was	VBD
pleased	VBN
in	IN

that	IN
the	DT

The	DT
morning	NN
sun	NN

shining	VBG
down	RP
with	IN
steadily	RB

warmth	NN

made	VBD
the	DT
shady	JJ

pleasantly	RB

She	PRP
looked	VBD
at	IN

of	IN
its	PRP$

Her	PRP$

She	PRP

resolving	VBG
to	TO

up	RP

and	CC

On	IN
the	DT

she	PRP
encountered	VBD
a	DT

wholesale	JJ

through	IN
the	DT

Without	IN

She	PRP

She	PRP

The	DT
pleasant	JJ

Somewhat	RB

On	IN

She	PRP

She	PRP

How	WRB
Minnie	NNP

she	PRP
never	RB

He	PRP

nothing	NN

there	EX

The	DT

It	PRP
blew	VBD
up	RP

one	CD
afternoon	NN
when	WRB
Carrie	NNP

She	PRP

In	IN

she	PRP

That	DT

her	PRP$

Towards	IN

when	WRB
she	PRP

Minnie	NNP
noticed	VBD
her	PRP$

``	``

She	PRP

The	DT

Hanson	NNP
said	VBD
perhaps	RB
she	PRP

it	PRP

Her	PRP$

For	IN
three	CD

she	PRP
wandered	VBD
about	RB

utterly	RB
dispirited	JJ

The	DT
attitude	NN
of	IN
the	DT

fast	JJ

She	PRP
hated	VBD
to	TO

Hanson	NNP

On	IN

she	PRP

borrowed	VBN

She	PRP

She	PRP

The	DT

Whenever	NNP

Temporarily	RB

It	PRP

latent	JJ
before	RB

which	WDT
now	RB

She	PRP

and	CC
began	VBD
to	TO
see	VB
glimmerings	NNS

Hurstwood	NNP
seemed	VBD
a	DT

in	IN

Her	PRP$

exceedingly	RB

in	IN

something	NN

She	PRP

She	PRP

As	IN
yet	RB

Hurstwood	NNP
had	VBD
only	RB
a	DT

of	IN

He	PRP
did	VBD
not	RB
feel	VB

anything	NN

His	PRP$

his	PRP$

Carrie	NNP

He	PRP

On	IN

In	IN
the	DT

Since	IN

he	PRP

that	IN

As	IN

How	WRB

Mrs.	NNP

Now	RB
that	IN

It	PRP

Hurstwood	NNP

``	``

He	PRP
grew	VBD
more	RBR

Many	JJ

He	PRP
saw	VBD

Through	IN

the	DT

Tangled	VBN

How	WRB

Then	RB

In	IN

there	EX

For	IN

If	IN

That	DT

At	IN

He	PRP

What	WP

him	PRP

She	PRP

Why	WRB
should	MD
she	PRP
taunt	VB
him	PRP
this	DT

unless	IN
she	PRP

good	JJ

He	PRP
began	VBD
to	TO
wish	VB

that	IN

Perhaps	RB

He	PRP
would	MD
go	VB

He	PRP
would	MD
have	VB
no	DT

By	IN
the	DT
time	NN
he	PRP
reached	VBD
his	PRP$

he	PRP
was	VBD
keenly	RB
alive	JJ
to	TO
the	DT
difficulties	NNS
of	IN

wished	VBD

over	IN

would	MD

that	IN
he	PRP

He	PRP
alighted	VBD
and	CC
went	VBD
up	RP
the	DT
steps	NNS
to	TO
the	DT
front	JJ

but	CC
it	PRP

He	PRP
pulled	VBD
out	RP

tried	VBD

another	DT

He	PRP
shook	VBD

the	DT

was	VBD
locked	VBN

Then	RB
he	PRP
rang	VBD
the	DT

No	DT

He	PRP
rang	VBD
again	RB

this	DT

Still	RB
no	DT

He	PRP
jangled	VBD
it	PRP
fiercely	RB
several	JJ

in	IN

without	IN

Then	RB
he	PRP
went	VBD
below	RB

There	EX
was	VBD
a	DT

opened	VBD
under	IN

protected	VBN
by	IN
an	DT
iron	NN

intended	VBN

When	WRB
he	PRP
reached	VBD
this	DT
he	PRP

it	PRP
also	RB

that	IN

What	WP
could	MD
it	PRP
mean	VB

He	PRP
rang	VBD
the	DT

and	CC
then	RB
waited	VBD

Finally	RB
,	,
seeing	VBG
that	IN
no	DT

he	PRP
turned	VBD

``	``

``	``
I	PRP

there	EX

He	PRP
climbed	VBD
moodily	RB
into	IN

relieved	JJ

So	RB
this	DT

Lord	NNP

what	WP

How	WRB

He	PRP
could	MD
hardly	RB
realise	VB
how	WRB
it	PRP
had	VBD
all	DT

It	PRP
seemed	VBD
a	DT
monstrous	JJ

Meanwhile	RB
he	PRP

What	WP

No	DT

To-morrow	NN
they	PRP

He	PRP
saw	VBD
that	IN
in	IN

recent	JJ
events	NNS
he	PRP
had	VBD
not	RB

He	PRP

now	RB
--	:
now	RB
what	WP

Supposing	VBG

Supposing	VBG
she	PRP
,	,
too	RB

wrote	VBD

It	PRP

Meanwhile	RB

He	PRP

getting	VBG
some	DT

out	IN

it	PRP

Every	DT

His	PRP$

He	PRP

He	PRP

For	IN

It	PRP

CHAPTER	NN

THE	DT
AMBASSADOR	NN
FALLEN	NN

A	DT
SEARCH	NN
FOR	IN
THE	DT
GATE	NNP
Carrie	NNP
,	,
left	VBD
alone	RB
by	IN
Drouet	NNP
,	,
listened	VBD
to	TO
his	PRP$
retreating	VBG
steps	NNS
,	,
scarcely	RB
realising	VBG
what	WP
had	VBD
happened	VBN
.	.

She	PRP
knew	VBD
that	IN
he	PRP
had	VBD
stormed	VBN
out	RP
.	.

It	PRP
was	VBD
some	DT
moments	NNS
before	IN
she	PRP
questioned	VBD
whether	IN
he	PRP
would	MD
return	VB
,	,
not	RB
now	RB
exactly	RB
,	,
but	CC
ever	RB
.	.

She	PRP
looked	VBD
around	IN
her	PRP$
upon	IN
the	DT
rooms	NNS
,	,
out	IN
of	IN
which	WDT
the	DT
evening	NN
light	NN
was	VBD
dying	VBG
,	,
and	CC
wondered	VBD
why	WRB
she	PRP
did	VBD
not	RB
feel	VB
quite	RB
the	DT

towards	IN
them	PRP
.	.

She	PRP
went	VBD
over	IN
to	TO
the	DT
dresser	NN
and	CC
struck	VBD
a	DT
match	NN
,	,
lighting	VBG
the	DT
gas	NN
.	.

Then	RB
she	PRP
went	VBD
back	RB
to	TO
the	DT
rocker	NN
to	TO
think	VB
.	.

It	PRP
was	VBD
some	DT
time	NN
before	IN
she	PRP
could	MD
collect	VB
her	PRP$
thoughts	NNS
,	,
but	CC
when	WRB
she	PRP
did	VBD
,	,
this	DT
truth	NN
began	VBD
to	TO
take	VB
on	RP
importance	NN
.	.

She	PRP
was	VBD
quite	RB
alone	RB
.	.

Suppose	VB
Drouet	NNP
did	VBD
not	RB
come	VB
back	RB
?	.

Suppose	VB
she	PRP
should	MD
never	RB
hear	VB
anything	NN
more	JJR
of	IN
him	PRP
?	.

This	DT
fine	JJ
arrangement	NN
of	IN

would	MD
not	RB
last	VB
long	RB

She	PRP
would	MD
have	VB

quit	VB
them	PRP

To	TO
her	PRP$
credit	NN
,	,
be	VB
it	PRP
said	VBD
,	,
she	PRP
never	RB
once	RB
counted	VBN
on	IN
Hurstwood	NNP

She	PRP
could	MD
only	RB
approach	VB
that	IN
subject	JJ
with	IN
a	DT
pang	NN
of	IN
sorrow	NN
and	CC
regret	NN
.	.

For	IN
a	DT
truth	NN
,	,
she	PRP
was	VBD
rather	RB
shocked	VBN
and	CC
frightened	VBN
by	IN
this	DT
evidence	NN
of	IN
human	JJ
depravity	NN
.	.

He	PRP
would	MD
have	VB
tricked	VBN
her	PRP$
without	IN
turning	VBG
an	DT
eyelash	NN
.	.

She	PRP
would	MD
have	VB
been	VBN
led	VBN
into	IN
a	DT
newer	JJR
and	CC
worse	JJR
situation	NN
.	.

And	CC
yet	RB
she	PRP
could	MD
not	RB
keep	VB
out	RP
the	DT
pictures	NNS
of	IN
his	PRP$
looks	NNS
and	CC
manners	NNS
.	.

Only	RB
this	DT
one	CD
deed	NN
seemed	VBD
strange	JJ
and	CC
miserable	JJ

It	PRP
contrasted	VBD
sharply	RB
with	IN
all	DT
she	PRP
felt	VBD
and	CC
knew	VBD
concerning	VBG
the	DT
man	NN
.	.

But	CC
she	PRP
was	VBD
alone	RB
.	.

That	DT
was	VBD
the	DT
greater	JJR
thought	NN
just	RB
at	IN

How	WRB
about	RB
that	IN
?	.

Would	MD
she	PRP

Would	MD

The	DT

Oh	UH

Drouet	NNP
had	VBD
spoken	VBN
about	IN
that	DT

Was	VBD
there	EX
any	DT

there	RB
?	.

She	PRP
moved	VBD
to	TO
and	CC
fro	NN
,	,
in	IN
deep	JJ
and	CC
varied	VBD
thoughts	NNS
,	,
while	IN
the	DT

slipped	VBD
away	RB
and	CC
night	NN
fell	VBD
completely	RB

She	PRP
had	VBD
had	VBN
nothing	NN
to	TO
eat	VB
,	,
and	CC
yet	RB
there	EX
she	PRP
sat	VBD
,	,
thinking	VBG
it	PRP
over	RP

She	PRP
remembered	VBD
that	IN
she	PRP
was	VBD
hungry	JJ
and	CC
went	VBD
to	TO
the	DT
little	JJ
cupboard	NN
in	IN
the	DT
rear	JJ
room	NN
where	WRB
were	VBD
the	DT
remains	NNS
of	IN

She	PRP
looked	VBD
at	IN
these	DT
things	NNS
with	IN
certain	JJ
misgivings	NNS

The	DT
contemplation	NN
of	IN
food	NN
had	VBD
more	RBR
significance	NN
than	IN
usual	JJ

While	IN
she	PRP
was	VBD
eating	VBG
she	PRP
began	VBD
to	TO
wonder	VB
how	WRB
much	JJ
money	NN
she	PRP
had	VBD

It	PRP
struck	VBD
her	PRP
as	IN
exceedingly	RB
important	JJ
,	,
and	CC
without	IN
ado	NN
she	PRP
went	VBD
to	TO
look	VB
for	IN
her	PRP$

It	PRP
was	VBD
on	IN
the	DT

and	CC
in	IN
it	PRP
were	VBD
seven	CD
dollars	NNS
in	IN

and	CC
some	DT

She	PRP
quailed	VBD
as	IN
she	PRP
thought	VBD
of	IN
the	DT
insignificance	NN
of	IN
the	DT
amount	NN
and	CC
rejoiced	VBD
because	IN
the	DT
rent	NN
was	VBD
paid	VBN
until	IN
the	DT

of	IN
the	DT

She	PRP
began	VBD
also	RB
to	TO
think	VB
what	WP
she	PRP
would	MD
have	VB
done	VBN
if	IN
she	PRP
had	VBD
gone	VBN
out	RP
into	IN
the	DT

when	WRB
she	PRP
first	RB

By	IN
the	DT

of	IN
that	DT
situation	NN

as	IN
she	PRP
looked	VBD
at	IN
it	PRP
now	RB

the	DT

seemed	VBD

She	PRP
had	VBD
a	DT

at	IN

and	CC
then	RB
,	,
perhaps	RB

everything	NN
would	MD

out	RP

after	IN

Drouet	NNP
had	VBD
gone	VBN

but	CC
what	WP
of	IN
it	PRP
?	.

He	PRP
did	VBD
not	RB
seem	VB
seriously	RB
angry	JJ

He	PRP
only	RB

He	PRP

There	EX

Here	RB

one	CD

He	PRP
had	VBD
left	VBN
his	PRP$
light	JJ
overcoat	NN
in	IN
the	DT

She	PRP
looked	VBD
about	RB

tried	VBD
to	TO
assure	VB

with	IN
the	DT
sight	NN
of	IN
a	DT

the	DT

Supposing	VBG

Then	RB
what	WP

Here	RB
was	VBD
another	DT

She	PRP

On	IN

The	DT

It	PRP

``	``

This	DT
was	VBD
his	PRP$
one	CD
resource	NN
against	IN
the	DT

He	PRP

the	DT

There	EX

really	RB
something	NN

He	PRP
who	WP

The	DT

How	WRB

all	DT

The	DT

came	VBD
to	TO

For	IN
the	DT
moment	NN
he	PRP
forgot	VBD
the	DT
letter	NN
from	IN
McGregor	NNP

If	IN
he	PRP

out	IN

perhaps	RB
it	PRP

He	PRP
would	MD

with	IN
herself	PRP
if	IN
only	RB
he	PRP

not	RB

Carrie	NNP

He	PRP
stood	VBD
up	RP

walked	VBD
about	RB

dreaming	VBG
his	PRP$

of	IN

It	PRP
was	VBD
not	RB

however	RB

before	IN
the	DT

back	RB

with	IN

what	WDT

He	PRP
thought	VBD

the	DT

He	PRP
had	VBD
done	VBN

here	RB

the	DT

It	PRP

a	DT

At	IN

the	DT

He	PRP
still	RB

the	DT

Even	RB

,	,
the	DT
last	JJ
fifteen	CD
minutes	NNS
passed	VBD
away	RB

it	PRP

Then	RB
he	PRP
abandoned	VBD

them	PRP
any	DT

that	DT

turned	VBD
to	TO

It	PRP

be	VB
observed	VBN
that	IN
the	DT

He	PRP
was	VBD
not	RB
troubling	JJ

His	PRP$
whole	JJ
thought	NN
was	VBD
the	DT
possibility	NN
of	IN

Nothing	NN

He	PRP

Their	PRP$

Would	MD

Then	RB

another	DT

Instinctively	RB
he	PRP

He	PRP
hurried	VBD

He	PRP

Oh	UH

came	VBD

with	IN
it	PRP
a	DT

that	WDT

so	IN
that	IN
the	DT

not	RB

Hurstwood	NNP
made	VBD
great	JJ

all	DT

without	IN
a	DT

of	IN
feeling	VBG
one	CD

He	PRP
pretended	VBD

in	IN
strengthening	VBG
the	DT

for	IN

He	PRP
contented	JJ

and	CC
rarely	RB

Thus	RB
the	DT

In	IN
the	DT
second	JJ

the	DT
business	NN
which	WDT
Hurstwood	NNP
managed	VBD
did	VBD
increase	VB

the	DT

Carrie	NNP

certain	JJ

and	CC
he	PRP
had	VBD
scraped	VBN
up	RP
a	DT

Being	VBG

rather	RB

nature	NN

Carrie	NNP

the	DT

Her	PRP$

Once	RB

but	CC
they	PRP

Hurstwood	NNP
naturally	RB
abandoned	VBD
his	PRP$

of	IN
fine	JJ

with	IN
her	PRP$

modified	VBN
his	PRP$

There	EX
were	VBD
no	DT

In	IN

without	IN

he	PRP
led	VBD
a	DT

which	WDT

neither	CC

Carrie	NNP
rather	RB

her	PRP$

He	PRP
also	RB

He	PRP

Now	RB

it	PRP
so	RB
happened	VBD
that	IN
from	IN

he	PRP

He	PRP
really	RB

that	DT
her	PRP$

him	PRP

he	PRP
drew	VBD
this	DT

With	IN

That	DT

since	IN

He	PRP

Once	RB

Another	DT

All	PDT
this	DT

in	IN

there	EX

A	DT

Either	CC

There	EX

the	DT

when	WRB
the	DT

almost	RB
perfectly	RB

and	CC
there	EX

Given	VBN

however	RB

the	DT

Slowly	RB

the	DT

So	IN
it	PRP

A	DT

a	DT

OF	IN
CHAFF	NNP
Carrie	NNP
pondered	VBD

once	RB

got	VBD
the	DT

It	PRP
took	VBD
several	JJ

for	IN

fully	RB
realise	VB
that	IN
the	DT
approach	NN
of	IN
the	DT
dissolution	NN
of	IN
her	PRP$
husband	NN

meant	VBD
commonplace	JJ
struggle	NN

Her	PRP$

went	VBD
back	RB
to	TO
her	PRP$
early	JJ

in	IN
Chicago	NNP

the	DT
Hansons	NNPS

their	PRP$

her	PRP$

revolted	VBD

That	DT
was	VBD
terrible	JJ

Everything	NN

out	RP

Her	PRP$
recent	JJ
experiences	NNS
with	IN

Vances	NNP
had	VBD
wholly	RB
unfitted	JJ
her	PRP$
to	TO
view	VB
her	PRP$

with	IN
complacence	NN

The	DT
glamour	NN
of	IN

in	IN
the	DT
few	JJ

her	PRP$

seized	VBD
her	PRP$
completely	RB

She	PRP
had	VBD
been	VBN
taught	VBN
how	WRB

and	CC
where	WRB
to	TO
go	VB
without	IN
having	VBG
ample	JJ
means	NNS
to	TO
do	VB
either	DT

Now	RB
,	,
these	DT
things	NNS
--	:
ever-present	JJ
realities	NNS
as	IN
they	PRP
were	VBD

filled	VBD
her	PRP$
eyes	NNS
and	CC
mind	NN

The	DT
more	JJR
circumscribed	JJ
became	VBD
her	PRP$
state	NN
,	,
the	DT
more	RBR
entrancing	JJ
seemed	VBD
this	DT

And	CC
now	RB
poverty	NN
threatened	VBD
to	TO
seize	VB

too	RB

the	DT

He	PRP

Hurstwood	NNP

the	DT

It	PRP
was	VBD

It	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
more	RBR

wholly	RB

Besides	IN

winter	NN

the	DT

In	IN

In	IN

He	PRP

but	CC
they	PRP

Now	RB

these	DT

They	PRP

He	PRP
tried	VBD

Sometimes	RB

This	DT

it	PRP

He	PRP

The	DT

The	DT

``	``

These	DT

The	DT

She	PRP

It	PRP
was	VBD

resulting	VBG
from	IN

Each	DT

drew	VBD

Now	RB

he	PRP

This	DT

Eventually	RB
these	DT

Also	RB

In	IN
his	PRP$

he	PRP
cut	VBD
down	RP
the	DT

then	RB
to	TO

Later	RB

finding	VBG
that	IN

Later	RB

On	IN

he	PRP

it	PRP
perished	VBD

She	PRP

He	PRP

``	``

It	PRP

the	DT
very	RB

that	WDT

True	JJ
to	TO

when	WRB

Not	RB

The	DT

Carrie	NNP

Frequently	RB

Now	RB

it	PRP

Her	PRP$

Suddenly	RB
the	DT

a	DT

As	IN

Next	JJ

Carrie	NNP

Hurstwood	NNP

``	``

He	PRP

north	RB

along	IN

idly	RB

Harlem	NNP

He	PRP

He	PRP

Passing	VBG
Fifty-ninth	NNP

Then	RB

It	PRP

The	DT

Coming	VBG

There	EX

The	DT

When	WRB

it	PRP

He	PRP

Unquestionably	RB

it	PRP
