CHAPTER	NN

A	DT
VISIT	NN
TO	TO
AN	DT
OLD	JJ
BACHELOR	NN
A	DT
FEW	NN
days	NNS
after	IN

a	DT
note	NN
came	VBD
from	IN
Mr	NNP
Holbrook	NNP
,	,
asking	VBG
us	PRP
impartially	RB
asking	VBG
both	DT

us	PRP
in	IN
a	DT
formal	JJ
,	,
old-fashioned	JJ
style	NN
,	,
to	TO
spend	VB
a	DT
day	NN
at	IN
his	PRP$
house	NN
a	DT
long	JJ
June	NNP
day	NN
for	IN
it	PRP
was	VBD
June	NNP
now	RB
.	.

He	PRP
named	VBD
that	IN
he	PRP
had	VBD
also	RB
invited	VBN
his	PRP$
cousin	NN
,	,
Miss	NNP
Pole	NNP
;	:
so	RB
that	IN
we	PRP
might	MD
join	VB

a	DT

which	WDT
could	MD
be	VB
put	VBN
up	RP

I	PRP
expected	VBD
Miss	NNP
Matty	NNP
to	TO
jump	VB
at	IN
this	DT
invitation	NN
;	:
but	CC
,	,
no	DT
!	.

Miss	NNP
Pole	NNP
and	CC
I	PRP
had	VBD
the	DT
greatest	JJS
difficulty	NN
in	IN
persuading	VBG
her	PRP
to	TO
go	VB
.	.

She	PRP
thought	VBD
it	PRP
was	VBD
improper	JJ
;	:
and	CC
was	VBD
even	RB
half	JJ
annoyed	JJ
when	WRB
we	PRP
utterly	RB
ignored	VBD
the	DT
idea	NN
of	IN
any	DT
impropriety	NN
in	IN
her	PRP$
going	VBG
with	IN
two	CD
other	JJ
ladies	NNS
to	TO
see	VB
her	PRP$
old	JJ

.	.

Then	RB
came	VBD
a	DT
more	RBR
serious	JJ
difficulty	NN
.	.

She	PRP
did	VBD
not	RB
think	VB
Deborah	NNP
would	MD
have	VB
liked	VBD
her	PRP
to	TO
go	VB
.	.

This	DT
took	VBD
us	PRP
half	PDT
a	DT
day	NN
's	POS
good	JJ
hard	JJ
talking	VBG
to	TO
get	VB
over	IN
;	:
but	CC
,	,
at	IN
the	DT
first	JJ
sentence	NN
of	IN
relenting	VBG
,	,
I	PRP
seized	VBD
the	DT
opportunity	NN

and	CC
wrote	VBD
and	CC
despatched	VBD
an	DT
acceptance	NN
in	IN
her	PRP$

day	NN
and	CC
hour	NN
,	,
that	IN
all	DT
might	MD
be	VB
decided	VBN
and	CC
done	VBN
with	IN

The	DT
next	JJ
morning	NN
she	PRP
asked	VBD
me	PRP
if	IN
I	PRP
would	MD
go	VB
down	RB
to	TO
the	DT
shop	NN
with	IN
her	PRP$
;	:
and	CC
there	RB
,	,
after	IN
much	JJ
hesitation	NN
,	,
we	PRP
chose	VBD
out	RP
three	CD

to	TO
be	VB
sent	VBN

and	CC
tried	VBD

,	,
that	IN

most	RBS
becoming	VBG
might	MD
be	VB
selected	VBN
to	TO
take	VB
with	IN
us	PRP
on	IN
Thursday	NNP

She	PRP
was	VBD
in	IN
a	DT
state	NN
of	IN
silent	JJ
agitation	NN
all	PDT
the	DT

to	TO
Woodley	NNP

She	PRP
had	VBD
evidently	RB
never	RB
been	VBN
there	RB
before	IN

and	CC
,	,
although	IN
she	PRP
little	RB
dreamt	VBD
I	PRP
knew	VBD
anything	NN
of	IN
her	PRP$
early	JJ
story	NN
,	,
I	PRP
could	MD
perceive	VB
she	PRP
was	VBD
in	IN
a	DT

at	IN
the	DT

of	IN
seeing	VBG
the	DT

which	WDT

and	CC

which	WDT
it	PRP

probable	JJ
that	IN

It	PRP
was	VBD
a	DT
long	JJ
drive	NN
there	RB
,	,
through	IN

jolting	JJ

Miss	NNP

looked	VBD
wistfully	RB
out	IN

the	DT

as	IN
we	PRP
drew	VBD
near	IN
the	DT

of	IN
our	PRP$
journey	NN

The	DT
aspect	NN
of	IN
the	DT
country	NN
was	VBD
quiet	JJ
and	CC
pastoral	JJ

Woodley	NNP
stood	VBD
among	IN
fields	NNS
;	:
and	CC
there	EX
was	VBD
an	DT
old-fashioned	JJ
garden	NN
where	WRB
roses	NNS

currant-bushes	NNS
touched	VBD
each	DT

and	CC
where	WRB
the	DT
feathery	JJ

formed	VBD
a	DT

to	TO

and	CC

;	:
there	EX
was	VBD
no	DT

We	PRP
got	VBD
out	RP

a	DT

up	RP

``	``

``	``
I	PRP

Miss	NNP

with	IN
a	DT
soft	JJ
plaintiveness	NN
in	IN
her	PRP$
voice	NN
,	,

almost	RB
in	IN
a	DT

for	IN
just	RB
then	RB
Mr	NNP

appeared	VBD
at	IN
the	DT
door	NN
,	,
rubbing	VBG
his	PRP$
hands	NNS
in	IN
very	RB
effervescence	NN
of	IN
hospitality	NN

He	PRP
looked	VBD
more	RBR

my	PRP$

of	IN

than	IN
ever	RB
,	,
and	CC
yet	RB
the	DT

only	RB
external	JJ

His	PRP$
respectable	JJ
housekeeper	NN
stood	VBD
modestly	RB
at	IN
the	DT

to	TO
bid	VB
us	PRP
welcome	VB

,	,
while	IN
she	PRP
led	VBD
the	DT
elder	JJR
ladies	NNS
upstairs	RB
to	TO
a	DT
bedroom	NN

I	PRP
begged	VBD
to	TO
look	VB
about	IN
the	DT
garden	NN

My	PRP$
request	NN
evidently	RB
pleased	VBD
the	DT
old	JJ
gentleman	NN
,	,
who	WP
took	VBD
me	PRP
all	DT
round	VBP
the	DT
place	NN
and	CC
showed	VBD
me	PRP
his	PRP$
six-and-twenty	JJ

named	VBN
after	IN
the	DT
different	JJ
letters	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
alphabet	NN

As	IN
we	PRP
went	VBD
along	RB
,	,
he	PRP
surprised	VBD
me	PRP
occasionally	RB
by	IN
repeating	VBG
apt	JJ

beautiful	JJ
quotations	NNS
from	IN
the	DT
poets	NNS

easily	RB
from	IN
Shakespeare	NNP
and	CC
George	NNP
Herbert	NNP
to	TO
those	DT

He	PRP
did	VBD
this	DT
as	IN
naturally	RB

he	PRP

thinking	VBG
aloud	RB
,	,
and	CC
their	PRP$

find	VB
for	IN
what	WP
he	PRP
was	VBD

To	TO
be	VB
sure	JJ
he	PRP
called	VBD
Byron	NNP
``	``

Byrron	NNP

''	''

pronounced	VBD
the	DT

of	IN
Goethe	NNP
strictly	RB
in	IN

with	IN
the	DT
English	NNP
sound	NN
of	IN

``	``

Altogether	RB

I	PRP
never	RB

who	WP

so	RB

a	DT

When	WRB
he	PRP

I	PRP

we	PRP
found	VBD
that	IN
dinner	NN
was	VBD
nearly	RB

I	PRP

only	RB
a	DT

The	DT

The	DT

The	DT

Mr	NNP

I	PRP
