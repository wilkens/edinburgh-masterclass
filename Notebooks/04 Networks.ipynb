    "In this brief session, we'll see how to use Gephi to calculate networks statistics concerning character relationships in a single novel (*Les Mis√©rables* by Victor Hugo, 1862). Nearly all of the work will happen in Gephi; here, a few definitions.\n",

    "* **Node**: An entity or object that has connections to other nodes. Here, a character in the novel.\n",
    "* **Edge**: A connection between nodes. Here, shared appeance by two characters on the same page.\n",
    "* **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a node.\n",
    "* **Closeness centrality**: Average number of hops from this node to each other node inthe network.\n",
    "* **Betweenness centrality**: Fraction of cases in which this node on the shortest path between two other nodes.\n",
    "* **Eigenvector centrality**: How well connected is this node to the most connected nodes?\n",
    "* **Modularity class**: The cluster of (relatively) closely connected nodes to which this node belongs.\n"
